# Ch. 6 成象 How to complete the idea.

谷神
不死
If one nourishes the spirits,
one dies not.

> 谷養也
谷 = 養 to nourish.
人能養神
則不死也
If one is able to nourish the spirits,
one does not die.
神
謂五藏之神也
By the spirits,
the spirits of the five viscera are meant.
肝藏魂
肺藏魄
心藏神
腎藏精
脾藏志
The liver contains the spiritual soul (hun 魂),
the lungs contain the animal soul (po 魄),
the heart contains the spirit (shen 神),
the kidneys contain the essence (ching 精),
the stomach contains the will (chi 志).
五藏盡傷
則五神去矣
If all of the five viscera are hurt,
then the five spirits flee.

>> On the linguistic and material impossibility of this explanation
which, in fact, has only been adopted
by very few even of the Taoist commentators,
see Conrady, Zu Lao-tze cap. 6, Asia Major 7 (1931), 150-156.
Ho-shang-kung's entire commentary on this chapter is translated in
Hans Neef,
Die im Tao-ts'ang enthaltenen Kommentare zu Tao-tê-ching Kapitel VI (1938),
pp. 55-56.

是謂玄牝
This is called the dark and the female.

> 言

不死之有在於玄牝
The Tao of immortality is contained within the dark one and the female.

The dark one is heaven.
於人

In man,
it forms the nose.
牝地也

Heaven nourishes man by means of the five atmospheres.
從鼻入藏於心
Through the nose they enter the viscera and penetrate to the heart.
五氣清微
為精神
聦明
音聲五性
The five atmospheres are pure and subtle,
they form the spirit,
the mind,
sound and voice and the five natures.
其鬼曰魂
Their demon is called the spiritual soul.
魂者雄也
The spiritual soul is male.
主出入人鼻與天通
It chiefly leaves and re-enters man through the nose in order to have intercourse with heaven.
故鼻為玄也
Therefore the nose is heaven (hsüan).

從口入藏於胃
Through the mouth they enter the viscera and penetrate into the stomach.
五性
濁辱

The five natures,
impure and thick,
form the appearance,
bones and flesh,
blood and pulses
and the six feelings.
其鬼曰魄
Their demon is called the animal soul.
魄者雌也
The animal soul is female.
主出入於口與天地通
It chiefly leaves and re-enters through the mouth in order to have intercourse with heaven and earth.
故口為牝也

{牝頻忍反}

>> Compare Conrady, 1. c.
The five atmospheres are the atmospheres of the five elements,
viz. rain, heat, cold, wind and fine weather,
see Mayers, Manual, p. 335, Numerical Categories no. 134.
The five natures, wu-hsing, 五性, are the natures of the five viscera
(see Ts'e-yüan s.v.).
In the last but one sentence we ought probably to read "with earth"
instead of "with heaven and earth",
as the po is related to earth as the hun is to heaven
(Neef 1. c. p. 56, n. 153 also expresses this view),
but no variant of this kind seems to exist.

□[^06-1]牝之門
是謂天地根
The gates of the dark one and of the female,
they are called the root of heaven and earth.

> 根元也
根 root = 元 origin.
言
This means:
鼻口之門是乃通天地之元氣所從往來
The gates of the nose and the mouth are whereby the original breath penetrating heaven and earth comes and goes.

綿綿若存
Without interruption it is like remaining.

> 鼻口呼噏喘息
Nose and mouth inhale and exhale.
當綿綿微妙
若可存復
若无有
This ought to be done uninterruptedly and in a mysterious way,
as if one could flee and return,
as if one did not exist.

>> V.1.: "as if one could remain, and again, as if one could not exist."

用之不勤
To use it is not fatiguing.

> 用氣常寛舒不當急疾懃勞也
In using the breath one ought to proceed with ease and not to make haste and to make oneself tired.
