What is without existence is called Tao.
道無形質
Tao is without form and substance.
故能出入無間
Thus it is able to leave and to enter where there is no space.
通神羣生也
It penetrates the spirits and assists every living creature.

"It penetrates the spirits and every living creature".

The doctrine of non-speaking,

> 法道不言
師之以身
If you take Tao for your model and do not speak,
you will govern by your personality.

there is the wrong reading 道法 "by law of the Tao".

無為之益

By taking Tao for one's model and doing nothing,
if one [thus] practises asceticism,
then this is of advantage to the spirit.

Of the princes within the empire,
few are able to obtain Tao and to govern by non-action,
to practise asceticism and to rule their countries [thus].
