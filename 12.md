五色令人目盲
The five colours make man's eyes blind.

五音令人耳聾
The five notes make man's ears deaf.

> 好聽五音
則和氣去心

五味令人口爽
The five tastes cause man's mouth to lose.

爽 shuang = 亡 wang to lose.
人嗜五味於口
則口亡

This means that it loses Tao.

>> For 亡 v.1. 忘 to forget.
For "it loses Tao" v.1. "it loses the taste of Tao".
Li Ch'iao points to the linguistic impossibility
of explaining shuang by wang,

see Erkes in Artibus Asiae V (1935), p. 296.
