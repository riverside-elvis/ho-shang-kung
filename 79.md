# Ch. 79 任契 How to fulfil the contract.

和大怨
When great hatred is reconciled,

> 殺人者
死
Who kills somebody,
will die.
傷人者
刑
Who hurts somebody,
will be mutilated.
以相和報
Thereby adequate requital is given.

必有餘怨
There will surely be a remnant of hatred.

> 任刑者失人情
Who relies on punishments will lose the inclinations of men.
必有怨及於良人也
Certainly there will be a remnant of hatred against good people.

>> 餘 "a remnant" is missing in one edition.

安可以為善
How can this be made good?

> 言
This means:
一人吁嗟
則失天心
If a man sighs,
he will lose the heart of heaven.
安可以和怨為善也
How could this be made good by reconciliation of hatred?

>> Instead of 吁 "sighs" v.1. 呼 "cries out".

是以聖人執左契
Therefore a saint takes the left tally,

> 古者聖人執左契合符信也
The saints of antiquity took the left tally to complete the contract.
無文書法律
They had neither written books nor laws.
刻契合符
以為信也
If the notched tally corresponded to the contract,
this was the credential.

>> On the ch'i 契, tallies, and the 符, contracts, see Conrady,
Die chinesischen Handschriftenund sonstigen
Kleinfunde Sven Hedins in Lou-lan (1920), pp. 60 a.f.

而不責於人
but makes no claims on others.

> 但刻契之信不責人以他事也
They only took the tally for a credential and wanted nothing else from others.

>> Instead of 契爲信 "the tally for a credential"
v.1. | 之 | "the legitimation by the tally".

有德司契
Therefore he who has Te examines the tally.

> 有德之君司{察契信而巳}
A prince who has Te examines the legitimation by the tally and examines what the people lose.

{無德司徹}

> {無德之君背其契言司人所失}

天道無親常與善人
It is the way of heaven to know no nepotism and always to assist the good man.

> 天道無有親踈
It is the way of heaven to have no relations.
唯與善人
則與司契者也
It only gives to the good man,
and then together with the legitimation it gives the tally.

>> Instead of 同 "together with"
v.1. 者 "and that is he to whom he gives the tally with the examination".
