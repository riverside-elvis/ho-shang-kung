# Ch. 53 益證 How to complete the evidence.

使我介然有知行於大道
If I with so much knowledge walk within the great Tao,

> 介大也
介 = 大 great.
老子疾時王
不行大道
Lao-tse thought the princes of his time to be sick,
as they did not cross the great pass.
故設此言
Therefore he spoke thus:
使我介然有知於政事
我則行於大道躬旡為之化
However much knowledge of government affairs I may have,
I walk within the great Tao and shall deal with them through the effects of non-action.

>> Instead of 主 "princes" v.1. 王 "kings".
Instead of 此言 "he spoke thus" v.1. 言 "he said".
Instead of 躬行 "deal with them" v.1. 躬, which makes no sense.
By the great pass Tao is meant.

唯施是畏
only display is to be feared.

> 唯獨也
唯 = alone.
獨畏有所施為
I am afraid of having alone what I display.
失道意
I am afraid to lose the meaning of Tao.
欲賞善
I want to esteem goodness.
恐偽善生
I am afraid of simulating a good life.
欲信忠
I wish for sincerity and loyalty.
恐詐忠起
I am afraid of false loyalty arising.

>> The explanation of 唯 by "alone" is linguistically inadmissible,
see note on ch. 21.

大道甚夷
Great Tao is very smooth.

> 夷平易也
夷 = smooth.

而民好徑
But the people love bypaths.

> 徑邪不平正也
Bypaths are bad and not smooth and straight.
大道丗平易
而民好從邪徑也
Tao is quite smooth,
but the people like to follow the bypaths which are bad and neither smooth nor straight.
{好呼報反}

>> 徑 "the bypaths" is wanting in some editions.

朝甚除
When the palace is very secluded,

> 髙臺榭宫室修
When high terraces are erected and pavilions and houses set up.

田甚蕪
when the fields are very weedy,

> 農事廢不耕治
When agricultural business is neglected and the time of ploughing missed.
{蕪音無}

倉甚虛
when the granaries are entirely empty,

> 五榖傷害國無儲也
When to the detriment of the country the grain is not stored.

服文綵
when one wears ornamented silk gowns,

> 好飾偽貴內華
When one loves deceit and fraud and esteems externals.

>> Instead of 貴外華 "esteems externals" v.1. | 肖 |.
The meaning remains the same.

帶利劒
when one wears sharp swords at the belt,

> 尚剛強武且奢
When one puts stress on strength and war and is prodigal besides.

厭飲食
when one commits excesses in eating and drinking,

> 多嗜欲無足時
When one wants much and there is never a time when one has enough.

財貨有餘
是謂盗夸
when one has superfluous riches
--- this is the boasting of a robber.

> 百姓而君有餘者
是由劫盗
When the people have not enough and the prince has too much,
that is the result of robbery.
以為服飾
持行夸人
不知身死
家破
親戚并隨也
By wearing ornaments,
by having intercourse with prodigal men,
by ignorance of death
the family is destroyed,
and the relatives will follow it.

>> Instead of 隨之 "follow it" v.1. 隨 "follow".

非道哉
This is really not Tao.

> 人君所行如是
此非道也
If a prince behaves thus,
this is certainly not Tao.
復言也哉者痛傷之辭
The following words 也哉 ye-tsai are an expression of woe.

>> 也 is wanting in one edition, probably by mistake.
