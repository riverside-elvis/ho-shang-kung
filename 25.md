# Ch. 25 象元 On the mystery of the idea.

有物
混成
There is a being,
chaotic but perfect.
先天地生
It preceded the birth of heaven and earth.

> 謂道無形混沌而成萬物
乃在天地之前
This means that Tao is chaotic and formless and bore everything,
thus preceding heaven and earth.
{混胡本反
先悉薦反}

>> The reading 成 "perfected" instead of 生 "bore" is meaningless.

寂□[^25-1]
Still, O!
寥□
Empty, O!
獨立而不改
Alone it stands and does not change.

> 寂者無音聲
To be still is to be without sound.
寥者空無形
To be empty is to be hollow and formless.
獨立者無匹雙
To be alone is to be mated with nobody.
不改者化有常
To be unchanging is to keep the eternal during the changes.

周行而不殆
Everywhere it goes without being endangered.

> 道通行
Tao goes everywhere;
天地无所不入
in heaven and earth there is no place which it does not enter.
在陽不焦
It is within the Yang without becoming burnt;
託隂不腐
it entrusts itself to the Yin without becoming rotten.
无不貫穿不危殆
There is nothing which it does not penetrate without endangering itself or perishing.
{殆田頼反}

>> Instead of 徧 "it goes everywhere" v.1. 通 "it penetrates everywhere".

可以為天下母
Thereby it could become the world's mother.

> 道育養萬物精氣如母之養子
Tao nourishes and educates the spiritual atmosphere of all things like a mother nourishing her children.

吾不知其名
I do not know its name.
字之曰道
To designate it I call it Tao.

> 我不見道形容
不知當何以名之
As I do not see the form of Tao,
I do not know how to designate it properly.
見萬物皆從道所生
故字之曰道也
As I see that all things are born from Tao,
I designate it by calling it Tao.

強為之名曰大
Forced to devise a name for it I call it the Great One.

> 不知其名
I do not know its name.
強曰大者
Constrained to name it I call it the Great One.
髙而无上
羅而无外
It is high and not above,
enmeshing and not outside.
无不包容
With everything it has patience.
故曰大也
Therefore it is called the Great One.
{強其文反}

大曰逝
The Great One is called the Passing One.

> 其為大
非若天常在上
非若地常在下
As it is great,
it is not like heaven which is eternally above,
nor like earth which is eternally below.
乃復逝去无常處所也
Thus it is passing and without a place of eternal rest.

逝曰逺
The Passing One is called distant.

> 言
This means:
逺者窮乎無窮
What is distant is the exhaustible within the inexhaustible.
布氣天地
It disperses its atmosphere through heaven and earth.
無所不通也
There is nothing which it does not penetrate.

逺曰反
Distant means returning.

> 言
This means:
其逺不越絶
Being distant it cannot be surpassed.
乃復
It is cut off, and then it returns.
在人身也
It exists within the body of man.

故道大
天大
地大
王亦大
Therefore Tao is great,
heaven is great,
earth is great,
the king is also great.

> 道大者包羅諸天地
無所不容也
The grandeur of Tao embraces heaven and earth,
and there is nothing which it does not contain.
天大者無所不蓋也
For the grandeur of heaven there is nothing which it does not cover.
地大者無所不載也
For the grandeur of earth there is nothing which it does not sustain.
王大者無所不制也
For the grandeur of the king there is nothing which he does not govern.

>> Instead of 制 "govern" v.1. 載 "sustain", which makes no sense.

域中有四大
Within the world there are four great ones,

> 四大
道
天
地
王也
The four great ones are
Tao,
heaven,
earth
and the king.
凡有稱有名
They all possess grandeur and splendour.
則非其極也
This is not their highest [achievement].
言道
則冇所由
What is called Tao,
this possesses what depends on it.
有所由然後
謂之為道
If it possesses what depends on it,
then it is called Tao.
然則是道稱中之大也不若無稱之大也
Then the grandeur which lies in the designation of the Tao is not like the grandeur of the undesignated one.
無稱不可得而名
The undesignated one cannot acquire glory.
曰域也
It is called the world.
天
地
王
皆在乎无稱之內也
Heaven,
earth
and the king
are within the undesignated one.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
域中有四大者也
Within the world there are the four great ones.

>> This part of the commentary is missing in the Tao-tsang edition.
