Attributed to Heshang gong 河上公;
Later Han (A.D. 25-220)

682 (fasc. 363)

"Commentary to the True Scripture
of the Way and its Power
by the Old Man on the River Bank."
The date and authenticity
of this commentary,
which in Huangfu Mi's 皇甫謐 (215-282)
*Gaoshi zhuan* 高士傅
is titled *Laozi zhangju* 老子章句,
have long been the object of debate.
The most radical view
was put forth by the Tang historian
Liu Zhiji 劉知幾 (661-721),
who simply denied the existence of the book
(see Liu Zhiji's biographies in
*Jiu Tang shu* 102
and *Xin Tang shu* 132).
The dating of the present commentary
has been hampered by
the identification of Heshang gong
with Heshang zhangren 河上丈人,
who is supposed to have lived
near the end
of the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.).
A date for the commentary is also complicated
by the lore surrounding Heshang gong in
Ge Hong's *Shenxian zhuan*
and in the apocryphal
"Laozi Daode jing xujue 老子道德經序訣"
attributed to the shadowy
Ge Xuan (traditional dates, 164-244).
In this lore,
Heshang gong is considered
to be a contemporary
of the Han emperor Wendi (r. 179-157 B.C.).

Adding to the confusion,
the bibliographical treatises
in *Jiu Tang shu* 47.2026
and *Xin Tang shu* 59.1514-15
mention a work with the title
*Laozi zhangjui* in two juan,
not authored by Heshang gong
but by Anqiu Wangzhi 安丘望之.
The latter apparently lived
at the time of the Han emperor
Chengdi (r. 32-7 B.C.).
Both of the Tang histories also mention,
apart from Anqiu Wangzhi's work,
Heshang gong's commentary
to the *Daode jing* in two juan.
*Sui shu* 34.1000
mentions a Heshang gong commentary
of the early Han (200 B.C.-A.D. 220),
while noting that
under the Liang (502-557)
there was a *Laozi jing* commentary
in two juan written by
Heshang zhangren of the Warring States period.

Heshang zhangren,
or the Elder from the Banks of the [Yellow] River,
is first mentioned
in Sima Qian's biography
of Yue Yi 樂毅 (*Shiji* 80.2436)
as the teacher
of An Qisheng 安期生
and as the originator
of a line of thought
that eventually influenced
Cao Can 曹參,
a prime minister under
Emperor Gaozu of the Han (r. 206-195 B.C.).
Cao Can was noted
for his sympathy
for the Huang-Lao doctrine.
Contrary to Huangfu Mi's
*Gaoshi zhuan* (quoted in TPYL 507),
however,
the *Shiji* makes no mention
of a *Daode jing* commentary
by Heshang zhangren.

Given the confusion
surrounding the identity
of Heshang zhangren
and of Heshang gong
and the role played by Anqiu Wangzhi,
it remains uncertain
whether the work now known as
the Heshang gong commentary
dates back to the late Warring States period
or to the early Han,
as stated by Ge Hong.
There are sufficient reasons,
however,
to conclude that
the present work dates
at least from
the middle or the end
of the Later Han (25-220 A.D.).
This date would imply that
the Heshang gong commentary
is one of the oldest
*Daode jing* commentaries
now in existence.
Rao Zongyi,
in his critical edition
of the Xiang'er commentary 想爾注
to the *Daode jing*
(*Laozi Xiang'er zhu jiaozheng*),
has found indications
that the Xiang'er commentary
quotes the commentary by Heshang gong
(on this issue,
see also the following article).
It is thus no coincidence
that in the Tang dynasty transmission rite
of the *Daode jing* to the so-called
students of the Eminent Mystery
(*gaoxuan dizi* 高玄弟子),
the Heshang gong commentary
was second only
to the *Daode jing* itself,
preceding the *Xiang'er zhu*
and four other texts
dealing with protocol and hagiography
(see Benn, *The Cavern-mystery transmission*, 84).

Formally,
the title of the present commentary
as mentioned by Huangfu Mi,
*Laozi zhangju*,
is an indication
of the Later Han
as a probable time of composition.
The Later Han
was the heyday
of the *zhangju* 章句 (chapters and phrases)
style of commentary.
The reaction against the *zhangju* style
came in the third century,
with the rise
of the so-called Neo-Taoism
of Wang Bi (226-249) and others.
As can be expected,
the Heshang gong commentary
is entirely free
of the metaphysical elements
omnipresent in Neo-Taoism.

Conversely,
Huang-Lao thought,
one of the dominant Han dynasty schools,
looms large in this commentary.
It has been noted
that in the course of the Han dynasty,
Huang-Lao thought witnessed
a shift in emphasis
from politics and society
to longevity.
The Heshang gong commentary
bears witness to this evolution.
The expression *zhishen zhiguo* 治身治國,
referring to the equal sustenance
of country and body,
is ubiquitous in this work.
In the commentary
to *Daode jing* chapter 59,
the equality of country and body
is explicitly stipulated
(*Guo shen tong ye* 國身同也).
Despite Heshang gong's insistence
upon the equal sustenance
of country and body,
a preference for the latter
is noticeable.
Thus,
the constant Tao
(*changdao* 常道)
in *Daode jing* 1
is explained as
"the Way to spontaneously attain longevity."
And in the commentary
to *Daode jing* 64,
it is said that
"[ordinary] people study
the administration of the country,
whereas the sage
studies the management
of the body."
Frequent reference
is made to longevity techniques,
such as in the commentary
to *Daode jing* 6,
where the Mysterious Female
(*xuanpin* 玄牝)
is for the first time likened
to the human nose and mouth.

Another noteworthy element
in Heshang gong's ideology
is that although certain Confucian values
are treated as inferior,
others are given a high status.
Thus,
in the commentary
to *Daode jing* 18,
it is stated that
when the Great Tao was active
(i.e., before the appearance
of humanity and righteousness,
which are regarded as pernicious
in both the *Daode jing*
and the Heshang gong commentary),
filial piety and loyalty
were to be found everywhere.
Similarly,
in the commentary to *Daode jing* 27,
it is said that
the sage saves the people
by constantly educating them
in loyalty and filial piety.

**Heshang gong** 河上公.
Heshang gong,
also known as Heshang zhangren 河上丈人,
is a an obscure figure
in the history of Taoism.
His existence itself is doubtful.
According to Sima Qian's *Shiji*,
he was a venerable
of the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.)
and the master of the immortal Anqi Sheng 安期生.
According to Ge Hong's
*Shenxian zhuan* 神仙傳,
Heshang gong was a hermit
living in retirement
on the banks
of the Yellow River.
Emperor Wen (r. 180-157 B.C.)
of the Western Han dynasty
sought him out there
to inquire about the Tao.
The influential *Loazi* 老子
commentary *682 Daode zhenjing zhu*
is attributed to this sage.

_The Taoist Canon_,
volume 3,
p. 1262.

**Ge Hong** 葛洪,
*zi* Yichuan 稚川,
*hao* Baopu 抱朴 (283-343).
The descendant
of a learned but poor family
of Jurong 句容 county in Jiangsu,
Ge Hong was the grandnephew
of Ge Xuan.
Selling wood to pay for his studies,
Ge Hong acquired a vast knowledge in literature
as well as various sciences and techniques,
especially alchemy,
medicine,
and Taoist methods.
He became the disciple
of the hermit Zheng Yin,
who taught him a method
for transforming cinnabar.
Later,
Ge served as a high military official.
Eventually moving to Guangdong,
he led a hermitic life
on Mount Luofu 羅浮山.
His aspiration was to achieve immortality,
and his thought was a synthesis
of Confucianism and longevity techniques,
based mainly on outer alchemy.
His most famous extant works
are contained in the two collections
*1185 Baopu zi neipian*
and *1187 Baopu zi waipian*.
His Biographies of divine Immortals
(*Shenxian zhuan* 神仙傳),
often quoted in ancient texts,
is now lost
but has been partially reconstructed.
Other lost works include
the *Zhenzhong shu* 枕中書 (cf. 166 *Zhongxian ji*)
and the *Yuhan fang* 玉函方.
The *917 Shenxian jinshao jing*,
*940 Jinnmu wangling lun*,
*842 Baopu zi yangsheng lun*,
*939 Dadan wenda*,
*1306 Ge xianweng zhouhou beiji fang*,
and *915 Huandan zhouhou jue*
are attributed to Ge
or are based on his writings.

**Ge Xuan** 葛玄,
*zi* Jiaoxian 教先
(traditional dates 164-244).
Also known as Zuo xiangong 左仙公,
Zuo xianweng 左仙翁,
or Ge xiangong 葛仙公,
Ge Xuan was a native
of Jurong 句容 county (in Jiangsu).
Ge was Zuo Ci's 左慈 disciple
and became Zheng Yin's master.
He was Ge Hong's great-uncle.
He is said to have practiced
ascesis on Gezao shan 閣皂山
in Jiangxi
and was an expert in Outer Alchemy.
In 1104,
he received the title Chongying zhenren 沖應眞人,
elevated in 1243
to Chongying fuyou zhenjun 沖應孚佑眞人.
Two works in the *Daoznag*,
*543 Xiaozai jiuyou chan*
and a commentary to the
*Yinfu jing*
(*III Yinfu jing jijie*)
are attributed to him.

**Zheng Yin** 鄭隱,
*zi* Siyuan 鄭思遠.
Little is known about Zheng Yin,
a scholar who lived
during the Western Jin dynasty (265-316).
He is said to have retired
to Mount Maji 馬跡山 Lujiang 廬江).
Other sources affirm that,
seeing the decline of the dynasty,
he retired to Mount Huo 霍山
and disappeared there.
He is famous
for having been Ge Xuan's disciple
and Ge Hong's master.
In the "Xialan pian 遐覽篇" (BPZ 19),
Ge Hong describes
the great number of books
written by Zheng Yin
and extols his extraordinary nature.
The *924 Zhenyuan miaodao yaolüe*
has been attributed to Zheng Yin.
It should be noted
that Zheng Yin was also the name
of a hermit on Mount Hua 華山
during the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127).

**Wang Bi** 王弼,
*zi* Fusi 輔嗣 (226-249).
Wang Bi, whose ancestral home
was in Gaoping 高平
(Shanyang 山陽, Shandong),
was born in Luoyang
in the immediate aftermath
of the fall
of the Later Han dynasty (25-220).
A member of a powerful clan
with a distinguished
intellectual and literary tradition,
Wang Bi moved in influential and fashionable circles
associating,
for example,
with the Wei dynasty (220-265)
minister of personnel
(*libu shangshu* 禮部尙書)
and famed debater
He Yan 何宴 (ca. 190-249).
One of the most prominent exponents
of the Mystery school
(Xuanxue 玄學) of philosophy,
Wang Bi expressed his highly original ideas
in the form of commentaries on the classics.
At the end of his short life,
he left influential commentaries
on the *Laozi* 老子
and the *Yijing* 易經.
His exploration
of the ontological concepts of
wu 無 (nonbeing) and you 有 (being),
in particular,
opened new perspectives
for cross-fertilization
with the Buddhist theory of emptiness
(*kong* 空) on the one hand,
and the evolving Confucian phenomenology
of substance (*ti* 體)
and function (*yong* 用),
on the other.
Giving free rein to his critical
and analytical powers,
Wang Bi exemplified
the ideal of youthful,
untrammeled genius
that briefly enjoyed a heyday in his time.
