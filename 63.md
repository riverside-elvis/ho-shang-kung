# Ch. 63 恩始 How to think of the beginning.

為無為
Act non-action.

> 因成脩
If you follow this, it will be completed.
故無所造作
Therefore do nothing.

事無事
Be occupied without occupation.

> 豫有備
Prepare everything beforehand.
除煩省事也
You will save trouble and reduce occupation.

>> Li Ch'iao rejects a different reading which runs thus:
Not having prepared anything beforehand,
you will be occupied with saving trouble.

味無味
Taste tastelessness.

> 深思逺慮
味道意也
By thinking deeply and beeing remotely afraid,
you will taste the meaning of Tao.

大小
Enlarge smallness.
多少
Augment minuteness.

> 陳其戒令也
欲大反小
欲多反少
By regulating injunctions and orders
one wants to turn the large into the small
and what is much into what is little.
自然之道也
This is the natural way.

報怨以德
Requite hatred with Te.

> 脩道
行善
絶禍於未生也
Cultivate Tao,
follow the good,
detach yourself from misfortune when it is still unborn.

>> Instead of 修道 "cultivate Tao" v.1. | 身 "practise asceticism".
After 行善 "follow the good" one edition repeats 修道 "cultivate Tao".
Instead of 未生 "when it is still unborn"
v.1. 人生 "within the life of man", rejected by Li Ch'iao.
The entire wording of Ho-shang-kung seems to be corrupt,
as it does not fit in with the text.
Yang Tseng-hsin, Lao-tse je-chi 5, 64a,
remarks that it would presuppose a reading 防怨以德 "avert hatred by Te".

圖難於其易
Plan the difficult within the easy.

> 欲圖難事
當於易時
未及成也
If you want to plan difficult things,
you ought to do it when they are easy,
that is when they are not yet completed.
{易以䜴反}

>> Instead of 當 "you ought" v.1. 先 "preceed with".
Instead of 易時 "when they are easy" v.1. 其 | "at the right time".

為大於其細
Do the great within the small.

> 欲為大事
必作於小禍亂從小來也

you must do them when little misfortune and confusion will come out of the small.

天下難事必作於易
The difficult affairs of the empire surely originate from the easy ones.
天下大事必作於細

夫輕諾必寡信

> 不重言也
