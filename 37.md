# Ch. 37 為政 How to exercise government.

道常無為
而無不為

Tao is always without action,
and nothing remains undone.

> 道以無為為常也
Tao by means of non-action effects the eternal.

侯王若能守
萬物將自化
If the princes and the king were able to retain it,
all things would change spontaneously.

> 言
This means:
侯王若能守道
萬物將自化效於己也
If the princes and the king were able to retain Tao,
all things would spontaneously change into their selves.

化而欲作
吾將鎭之以無名之朴
If they change and want to rise,
the ego will suppress them by means of the simplicity of the nameless.

> 吾身也
The ego is the personality.
無名之朴道也
The simplicity of the nameless is Tao.
萬物以化效於己也
復欲作巧偽者
侯王當身鎮撫
以道德
If all beings change into their selves,
but afterwards revert to desire and exhibit shrewdness and hypocrisy,
the princes and the king are obliged to suppress personality
by means of Tao and Te.

無名之朴亦將不欲
The simplicity of the nameless will neither have desires.
不欲
以靜
As there are no desires,
there will be peace.

> 言
This means:
侯王鎮撫以道德
民亦將不欲
If the princes and the king suppress them with Tao and Te,
the people will neither have desires.
改當以清靜導化之也
Therefore they must be changed by means of purity and quietness.

The empire will spontaneously become rectified.

天下將自正定也
If one is able to resemble this,
the empire will spontaneously become corrected.
