# Ch. 67 三寶 On the three jewels.

天下皆謂我大
似不肖
If all within the empire call my Tao great,
I seem unworthy.

> 老子言
Lao-tse says:
天下謂我德大
我則佯愚似不肖
If all within the empire call my Tao great,
then I pretend to be stupid and seem to be unworthy.

夫唯大
故似不肖
Now because one is great,
therefore one is unworthy.

> 唯獨名德大者
為身害
Who is only called great in Tao,
that one will hurt his body.
故佯愚似若不肖
Therefore one should pretend to be stupid and seem to be unworthy.
无所分别無所割截
Nothing is separated and nothing cut asunder.
不賤人而自貴
Do not disdain others nor esteem yourself.

>> Instead of 唯 "only" v.1. 夫 "now". "That one" is missing in one edition.

若肖久矣
To seem to be worthy is to endure.

> 肖善也
Worthy is good.
謂辨惠也
It means convincing.
若大辨惠之人
身髙自貴
If somebody convinces others,
he is esteemed himself.
行察察之政所從來久矣
To run a government with much sharpsightedness has always endured.

>> Instead of 辯 "convincing" v.1. 辨 "discriminating",
probably a mere misprint.
The last sentence seems corrupt,
as it expresses a view contrary to Taoist ideas;
comp. ch. 58.
Probably a negative particle is missing.

其細
This is really trifling.

> 言
This means:
辨惠者唯如小人也非長者
Who convinces is only like a mean fellow and not like a superior.

夫我有三寳
I have three jewels.
持而寳之
I prize and keep them.

> 老子言
Lao-tse says:
我有三寳
I have three jewels.
抱持而保倚
I prize them and keep hold of them.

一曰慈
The first is called kindness.

> 愛百姓若赤子
He loves the people like a little child.

二曰儉
The second is called thriftiness.

> 賦儉若取之於己也
He raises taxes as if he took them from himself.

三曰
The third is called:
不敢為天下先
not daring to play the first part in the empire.

> 執謙
退
不為倡始也
He keeps to modesty,
retires
and does not play the leading part.

>> V.1.: "and does not dare to play the leading part".
The Che-yao renders the commentary thus:
He keeps to modesty, retires and does not play the leader.

慈
故能勇
Now who is kind,
therefore is brave.

> 以為仁故能勇於忠孝也
By making use of kindness and humanity one may be brave in loyalty and filial piety.

儉故能廣
Who is thrifty may therefore be large-minded.

> 天子身能節儉
故民日用廣矣
When the son of heaven is personally able to be large-minded,
then the people daily make use of his large-mindedness.

>> The words 天子 t'ien-tse "the son of heaven" are missing in the Che-yao.
The same work reads instead of 大廣 "large-mindedness"
厚寬 "the fulness of large-mindedness".

不敢為天下先
Who dares not play the first part within the empire,

> 不為天下首先
Do not want to be the head of the empire.

故能成器長
may thereby complete the duration of the vessel.

> 成器長謂得道人也
To complete the duration of the vessel means to be enabled to become a Taoist.
我能為道人之長也
I may be the first among Taoists.
{長張丈反}

今捨慈且勇
Today one neglects kindness and is at the same time bold.

> 今世人舎慈仁但為勇武也
Now the world gives up humanity and kindness and wages war.

舎儉且廣
One neglects thriftiness and is at the same time large-minded.

> 舎其儉約但為奢泰
One gives up thriftiness and only indulges in profusion.

舎後且先
One neglects retirement and precedes at the same time.

> 舍其後己但為人先
One desists from putting the self in the background and only precedes others.

死矣
This is deadly.

> 所行如此動入死地
By behaving thus one moves along the way leading to death.

夫慈
Now as to kindness:
以戰則勝
By fighting with it one will vanquish.
以守則固
By protecting with it one will secure.

> 夫慈仁者
百姓親附
并心一意
Now as to the kind and humane one,
the people will draw near to him,
[and there will only be] one opinion within two hearts.
故以戰則勝敵
以守衛則堅固
Therefore by war one vanquishes,
by protective measures one remains secure.

天將救之
Heaven wants to save him.
以慈衛之
With kindness it protects him.

> 天將救助善人
Heaven wants to help the good man.
必與慈仁之性
Surely it enables him to help by his kind and humane character.
{使能自當助也}
