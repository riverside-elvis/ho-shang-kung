# Ch. 21 虛心 How to empty the heart.

孔德之容
The endurance of great Te

> 孔大也
孔 = great.
有大德之人無所不容
Men of great Te are able to endure everything.
能受垢濁處謙卑也
They are able to take up dirt and dust and to live in humble loneliness.

唯道是從
follows alone Tao.

> 唯獨也
唯 = alone.
大德之人不隨世俗所行
Men of great Te do not follow the doings of the vulgar.
獨從於道也
They only follow Tao.

>> The explanation of 唯 as "alone" is linguistically impossible,
though many other commentators and several translators
follow Ho-shang-kung's explanation.
唯是 with the object interposed is a fixed expression
belonging to the pre-classic language and means nothing but;
it is ... what (see Gabelentz, Chinesische Grammatik, § 804a).
The sentence means therefore; "It is Tao which they follow."

道之為物唯怳
唯忽
Tao's relation to the beings is alone ecstatic,
alone abstruse.

> 道之於萬物獨怳忽往來
於其无所定也
Tao's relation to all beings is alone ecstatic and abstruse,
as it has intercourse with their baselessness.
{怳泥往反
又呼廣反}

>> This explanation is just as untenable.
道之爲物 can only mean "Tao's being a being",
and 唯 before 恍 and 惚 is only intelligible
if it is again taken in its pre-classic meaning "it is".
The sentence thus means: "Tao's being a being is ecstatic, is abstruce."

忽□[^21-1]怳□其中有像
In ecstasy and abstruseness it is an image.

> 道唯忽怳
无形之中獨為萬物法像
Though Tao is ecstatic and abstruse,
it is within the formlessness alone the model of all beings.

>> Ho-shang-kung's interpretation, which is in any case more than doubtful,
only becomes intelligible if we assume
that his text of Lao-tse had the wording
惚恍中有象,
as Li Ch'iao reconstructs it.
With the general reading
惚兮恍兮,
其中有象,
which is confirmed by a quotation in Huai-nan-tse 12, 16a, it is incompatible.

怳□忽□其中有物
In ecstasy and abstruseness it is a being.

> 道唯怳忽
其中有一
Though Tao is abstruse and ecstatic,
there is unity within it.
經營生化
因氣立質
It effects the changes,
helps the breath and establishes reality.

>> This explanation also presupposes the reading
惚恍中有物
which Li Ch'iao reconstructs, instead of the current text
恍兮惚兮,
其中有物.

窈□冥□其中有精
In deepness and darkness it has the essence.

> 道唯窈
冥
无形
Tao is only deep,
dark
and formless;
其中有精實
within itself it has got the essence.
神明相薄
隂陽交㑹也
Surely the spirits press each other,
and Yin and Yang unite with each other.
{窈烏了反}

>> Instead of 道唯 "Tao is only" Li Ch'iao reads 道德 "Tao and Te"
which is surely to be rejected.
Instead of the final 也 the Tao-tsang edition has 之.

其精甚眞
Its essence is very real.

> 言
This means:
存精氣
其妙甚眞非有飾也
The atmosphere of the existing reality,
its secret is very real and without appearance.

>> Instead of "the existing reality" v.1. "the reality of Tao".

其中有信
Within itself it has truth.

> 道匿功藏名
Tao conceals its merit and hides its glory.
其信在中也
Its truth is within itself.

自古及今其名不去
From antiquity till today its name does not vanish.

> 自從也
It follows itself.
自古至今道常在不去
From antiquity till today Tao eternally exists and does not vanish.

以閱衆甫
Thereby it takes care of the beginning of everything.

> 閱禀也
閱 = to take care of.
甫始也
甫 = beginning.
言道禀與萬物始生
Tao takes care of the beginning life of all beings.
從道
受氣
If one follows Tao,
one preserves the breath.

吾何以知衆甫之然哉
How do I know that this is the case with the beginning of everything?

> 我何以知從道受氣
How do I come to know that all beings preserve their breath if they follow Tao?

>> In the Tao-tsang edition
the commentary accompanying this sentence is wanting;
in other editions the words "all beings" are left out.

以此
By this.

> 此今也
"This" is the present (今).
以今萬物皆得道精氣而生
By the present all beings receive the breath of Tao and live and thrive.
{動作起居}
非道不然
Without Tao this would not be the case.

>> This commentary is also wanting in the Tao-tsang edition.
In the last sentence, "Tao" is probably a mistake for "the present".
--- Comp: the same phrase in ch. 57.
