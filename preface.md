# Appendix: Preface

The following is the preface from
_Ho-Shang-Kung: Ho-Shang-Kung's commentary on Lao-Tse._
Translated and annotated by Eduard Erkes, 1958.

---

No Chinese book has been so often translated into European languages
as Lao-tse's Tao-te-ching.
More than fifty translations exist, and new ones constantly appear.

In spite of this, it would be rather a mistake to suppose
that all these translations had transmitted a real knowledge
of Lao-tse's philosophy to the European public
or even to the small circle of scholars
interested in the philosophic and religious aspects of early Taoism.
They neither give a picture of Lao-tse as he stood among his contemporaries
nor do they show him in his importance
for the China of later times or of today.
This is not because they were made
with insufficient linguistic or material knowledge,
for besides some translations which might as well have remained unprinted
there are such excellent renderings as those given by
Julien, Strauss, Carus, Richard Wilhelm, Castellani and Waley,
but because in every European translation the conceptions of the translator
inevitably come too strong into the foreground,
whereas the conceptions of the Chinese are relegated to a minor position.
Besides this, the European translator almost unconciously adheres
to that Chinese interpretation which is most congenial to him,
and thus the entire European conception of Lao-tse
is not guided by the own ideas of the Taoists
which are rather difficult to grasp for the average European mind
but more or less dominated by the explanations
furnished by the Confucian commentators which are, as a rule,
far more congenial to Western ideas,
first of all by those of Wang Pi,
the great founder of this school of interpreters
of the Tao-te-ching[^preface-1].

But though the merits of the Confucian interpreters of the Tao-te-ching
must certainly not be underrated,
the work of Wang Pi and his successors being the more important
as it is at the basis of the meaning which the book has
for the great Confucian majority of the Chinese people,
we ought not to forget that Lao-tse was a Taoist
and that his work must therefore be understood
as a production of Taoist mentality,
whereas Wang Pi, as Richard Wilhelm very aptly puts it,
changed the book "from a compendiary of magical meditation
to a collection of free philosophical aperçus"[^preface-2].
If we therefore want to know the real Taoist Lao-tse,
we must learn to see him as the Taoists themselves behold him
and to comprehend the Tao-te-ching as that revelation of meditative experience
which it always was to the Taoists and doubtless to its author himself.
Who wants to understand Taoism
as the outcome of religious and philosophic experience
cannot ignore the study of the Taoist commentaries
and excuse himself with the cheap and unjust phrase
that the Taoists had misunderstood and wilfully misinterpreted their master.
To judge of the merits or demerits of the Taoist interpreters,
one must not only have read them carefully,
but as well have had a personal experience of the state of mind
out of which the Taoist conceptions of Lao-tse have grown.
And I doubt very much if anyone who has fulfilled
these two necessary conditions would pass such a sweeping judgment.

Now as the study of Taoist literature is only possible
to very few Western scholars interested in Chinese philosophy,
and as probably only an even much smaller number
will have occasion to learn Taoist meditation
and thereby to enter that state of mind
which is peculiar to the Taoist ascetic and thinker,
it hardly needs an excuse if here for the first time
a Taoist commentary explaining Lao-tse is given in full translation.
It is almost self-evident
that the oldest existing publication of this kind was chosen,
as from this commentary, that of Ho-shang-kung,
the entire literature of Taoist commentators proceeds.
This does not mean that Ho-shang-kung
enjoys anything like canonical authority.
A large number of his explanations
are not shared by the majority of Taoist interpreters,
and some of them are almost universally regarded as untenable.
But nevertheless Ho-shang-kung if of fundamental importance
for the general Taoist conception of the Tao-te-ching,
and a thorough study of Lao-tse's doctrine ought therefore to begin with him.

My translation only wants to render Ho-shang-kung, not to justify him.
To enter critically into his ideas would be impossible
without referring to the divergent opinions of other commentators
and therefore largely transcend the scope of a translation.
I hope to publish such a comparative criticism
of the interpretations of Lao-tse in another book.
Here I have restricted my editorial work to the reproduction of the variants,
the explaining of obscure terms and phrases
and the verifying of occasional quotations and literary parallels.
Only some passages where Ho-shang-kung's interpretations
involve obvious linguistic impossibilities had to be critically analyzed.

The translation of Lao-tse's text had of course
to follow the interpretation as given by Ho-shang-kung.
I therefore wish to state that
also where I have made no special reference
it in no way always conforms to my own ideas
but simply reproduces the conceptions of Ho-shang-kung.

To my dear friend, Mr. Chou Ku-yü 周古愚 (Ching-yü 景俞),
former Lecturer in Chinese in the university of Leipzig,
an excellent conoisseur of Taoism,
I am much indebted for the invaluable assistance he gave me
during the completion of this work.
Not only did he peruse my translation together with me
and make more than one obscure passage clear to me,
but through his mediation it was possible for me
to get into circles in Peking
where I was able to learn Taoist meditation
and to acquire myself the mentality of the Taoist mystic
without which it is impossible fully to understand Taoist thinking.
Without this preparation I could hardly have ventured on this translation.

To Professor Richard Hadl I owe sincere gratitude
for the scientific understanding,
and technical skill which he has shown as editor
of the series in which my work appears.
