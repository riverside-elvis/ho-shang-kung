# Ch. 75 貪損 How to diminish craving.

民之飢以其上食稅之多
The hunger of the people comes from their prince's consuming the bulk of the revenues.

> 人民所以飢深者以其君上稅食下太多
That the people are hungry and cold has its reason in their prince's raising too many taxes from his subjects.

是以飢
Therefore they are hungry.

> 民皆化上為矣
The people are altered by their prince and thereby become greedy.
叛道
違德
They rebel against Tao
and are opposed to Te.
故飢
Therefore they are hungry.

>> After 貪 "greedy" one edition has the final particle 矣.

民之難治以其上之有為
The people's being difficult to govern comes from their prince's fussing about.

> 民之不可治者以其君上多欲好有為也
That the people cannot be governed has its reason in their prince's having many wishes and wanting to fuss about.

是以難治
Therefore they are difficult to govern.

> 是以其民化上有為
The people are altered by their prince and fuss about.
情偽
難治
Their character becomes hypocritical,
and they are difficult to govern.

>> The Tao-tsang edition begins the first sentence with 是以 "thereby"
and omits the final particle 也 at the end of the second sentence.

民之輕死以其求生之厚
That men take death easy comes from their seeking for the fulness of life.

> 人民輕犯死者以其求生活之道太厚
That the people easily risk their lives is because their way of seeking for life is too much bent on gain.
貪利以自危
Thereby they endanger themselves.

>> Instead of 道 "way" v.1. 事 "doings".

是以輕死
Therefore they take death easy.

> 以求生太厚之故
輕入死地也
Because they seek for the great fulness of life,
they take it easy to get themselves on death-bringing ground.

>> The expression 死地 se-ti, here translated by "death-bringing ground"
occurs in ch. 50 where it has a different meaning,
indicating a deadly spot of the body.
Here it is doubtless to be taken in another sense,
probably as a military expression found in Sun-tse II, Ia,
where se-ti occurs among the nine strategically important formations
of the ground and is defined as follows:
"Where one survives by fighting quickly and perishes without fighting quickly,
there is the death-bringing ground".
Lionel Giles, Sun-tse (1910), p. 117, translates "desparate ground".
Waley, The Way and Its Power (1934),
seems in his commentary on ch. 50
to have mistaken Ho-shang-kung's explanation for that of Sun-tse,
as he correctly translates se-ti by "death-spot"
but explains it as "a military expression" which it is not in this sense.

夫唯無以生為者是賢於貴生
Now he who lays stress on life is worthier that he who values life.

> 夫唯獨無以生為務者
爵禄不干於意
財利不入於身
天子不得臣
諸侯不得使
則賢於貴生也
If one now thinks life alone not the most important thing,
if dignities and emoluments are not occupying the mind,
if wealth and profit do not enter the thoughts,
if the emperor does not get you for his minister
and the prince does not get you for his official,
this is wiser than valuing life.

>> Instead of 干 "enter" v.1. 上,
making no sense and therefore to be rejected.
Instead of 心 "mind" v.1. 身 "body",
to be rejected for the same reason,
as Li Ch'iao remarks.
The sentence
"If the emperor does not get you for his minister
and the prince does not get you for his official"
is a quotation from Chuang-tse 28, 7b (SBE 40, 158),
apart from the last word which in Chuang-tse
is 友 "friend" instead of 使 "official",
Li Ch'iao quotes an unintelligible variant 有,
probably a misprint for 友.
For Pelliot's remarks on this passage, see introduction, note 8.
