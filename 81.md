# Ch. 81 顯質 How to display reality.

信言不美
Sincere words are not beautiful.

> 信者如其實
Sincere words are true words.
不美者朴且質也
What is not beautiful is simple and real.

>> The first sentence has the following variant 信言者如其實
(the Tao-tsang edition adds 也) "Sincere words correspond to their reality".

美言不信
Beautiful words are not sincere.

> 滋美之言者孳孳華詞
Beautiful words are superficial talks of rich beauty.
不信者飾
偽
多空虚也
Insincerity is outward,
hypocritical
and extremely empty.

>> For the first sentence, Li Ch'iao gives the following variant:
道美之言者孳孳華詞
"Superficial and beautiful words are incessant flowery talks."
The Tao-tsang edition has the same reading
but instead of the last two characters
美辭
"beautiful sayings".

知者不博[^81-1]
The knowing one is no scholar.

> 知者謂知道之士
The knowing one is the knowing Taoist.
不博者守一元也
The unlearned one comprehends unity as the origin.

>> A variant of the last sentence reads: 知道守一則不必博
"Who knows Tao and preserves unity is surely no scholar".

博者不知
The scholar is ignorant.

> 博者多見聞
不知者
失要真也
The scholar sees and hears much,
but as he is ignorant,
he loses what is important and true.

>> V.1.:
多見聞
失眞要.
故不知.
"As he sees and hears much,
he loses what is most important.
Therefore he is ignorant."

善者不辯
The good man does not discuss.

> 善者以道修身
The good man practises asceticism by means of Tao.
不綵文也
As he does not cultivate discussions,
he has no outward elegance.

辯者不善
Who discusses is not good.

> 辯者謂巧言也
Who discusses speaks beautiful words.
不善者
舌致患也
As he is not good,
he creates sorrow by means of his tongue.
山有玉
掘其山
If a mountain contains jade,
that mountain will be dug out.
水有珠
濁其淵
If a lake contains pearls,
its depths will be sullied.
辯口多言
亡其身
If a discussing mouth speaks much,
it will lose its body.

>> Li Ch'iao notes that a T'ang edition writes 泉 ch'üan "source"
instead of 淵 yüan "depth", as yüan was a tabooed character under the T'ang,
being the personal name of the emperor T'ang Kao-tsu (Li Yüan 李淵).

聖人不積
A saint does not hoard.

> 聖人積德不積財
A saint hoards Te but he does not hoard treasures.
有德
以教愚
If he has Te,
he instructs the stupid ones.
有財
以與貧也
If he possesses treasures,
he gives them to the poor.

>> Instead of 與 "gives" v.1. 施 "presents".

既以為人巳愈有
Having worked for others he has himself the more.

> 既以為人施設德化
己愈有德
After having divided his Te among others,
he himself has got the more of it.

>> This commentary is missing in one edition, as Li Ch'iao remarks.

既以與人己愈多
Having given to others he himself possesses the more.

> 既以財賄布施與人
而財益多
如日月之光無有盡時也
After having divided his treasures among others,
his own treasures have augmented the more,
as the splendour of the sun and moon never becomes exhausted.

>> Instead of 施於人 "divided among others" v.1. | 與 |, the same.

天之道利而不害
The way of heaven is to bless and not to hurt.

> 天生萬物
愛育之
令長大
無所傷害也
Heaven begets all beings,
loves them and educates them,
makes them grow
and never hurts them.

聖人之道為而不爭
The way of the saint is to act and not to contend.

> 聖人法天
The saint takes heaven for his model.
所施為化成事就
He displays nothing but perfects his affairs.
不與下爭
Then he does not contend with his subjects.
功名
故能全其聖功也
His merit becomes famous,
and therefore he is able to complete his saintly merit.
