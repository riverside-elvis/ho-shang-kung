玄 hsüan, the dark one, is heaven.
言有欲之人
與無欲之人
同受氣於天
This means that the man who has desires
and the man who has none
together receive the breath from heaven.

>> This interpretation of hsüan which Ho-shang-kung
constantly repeats is linguistically impossible,
as hsüan only means heaven in the combination hsüan-huang
"the blue one and the yellow one" = heaven and earth,
but never if used alone.

玄之又玄
The one still darker than the dark one.

> 天中復有天也
In heaven there is another heaven.
稟氣有厚薄
This means that the bequeathed breath has fulness and weakness.

If one reaches the middle harmony and the fertilizing fluid,
then it produces dignity and saintliness.
得錯亂汚辱
則生貪淫也
If one reaches perverted confusion and dirty shame,
then it produces avariciousness and licentiousness.

>> Instead of 污辱 "dirty shame" v.1. 濁厚 "dirty luxuriousness".

衆妙之門
The gate of every mystery.

> 能知天中復有天
禀氣有厚薄
除情
去欲
守中和
If one is able to know that within heaven there is another heaven,
if the bequeathed breath has fulness and weakness,
then one casts aside the feelings,
drives away the desires
and maintains the middle harmony.
是謂知道要之門户也
This is called knowledge of the gate that leads to the most important of Tao.
