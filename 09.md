# Ch. 9 運夷 How to let ease circulate.

持而盈之不如其已
To hold and to fill is not as if it were something that might be stopped.

> 盈滿也
盈 = 滿 to fill.
已止也
已 = 止 to stop.
持滿
必傾
If something is held and filled,
one is sure to spill.
不如止也
This is not like stopping (i.e. then it is better to stop).

揣而銳之不可長保
To handle and to fill cannot be safe for long.

> 揣治也
揣 = 治 to handle.
先揣之
後必弃捐
First one handles something,
and then one throws it away.
{揣初委反}

金玉滿堂
莫之能守
If gold and jade fill the hall,
nobody is able to guard it.

> 嗜欲傷神
Desire hurts the spirits.
財多累身
Fulness of riches impedes the body.

>> The spirits are again the spirits of the five viscera.

富
貴
而驕
自遺其咎
To be rich,
honoured,
and then haughty,
leads of itself to misfortune.

> 夫富當賑貧
貴當憐賤
Now a rich man ought to be benevolent against the poor,
a man of high standing ought to pity those in lower positions.
而反
驕恣必被禍患也
But on the other hand,
haughtiness and intemperance are sure to meet with misfortune.
{遺唯季反
咎求九反}

功成
名遂
身退
Merit is achieved,
glory follows,
the personality recedes.
天之道
This is the way of heaven.

> 言
This means:
人所為功成事立
名迹稱遂
不退身避位
則遇於害
Whatever a man may do to achieve merit and to do business,
to have his name discovered so that glory may follow,
to have his personality not put behind and a place of honour not avoided,
this leads into misfortune.
此乃天之常道也
譬如日中則移
月滿則□[^09-1]
物盛則衰
樂極則哀
This is then the eternal way of heaven,
as for example the sun sinks down when in the zenith,
the moon wanes when full,
plants fade when in full bloom,
music becomes moanful when in full swing.

>> Instead of 人所爲 "whatever a man may do"
Li Ch'iso reads 人所謂 "whatever a man may say" which hardly makes sense.
