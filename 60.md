# Ch. 60 居位 How to remain on the throne.

治大國若烹小鮮
Rule a large country as if you were cooking small fish.

> 鮮魚
Hsien 鮮 are fishes.
烹小魚
不去腸
不去鱗
When cooking small fishes,
the intestines are not taken out
and the scales not scraped off.
不敢撓
恐其糜也
One does not dare to scratch them,
for fear that they might go to pieces.
治國煩
則下亂
When in governing a country one causes trouble,
then the subjects will become confused.
治身煩
則精散
When in practising asceticism one causes trouble,
then the spirit will become distrait.

>> Instead of 削 "scraped off" v.1. 去 "removed".
Instead of 散 "will become distrait" v.1. 去 "will flee".

以道莅天下
其鬼不神
When one manages the Empire with Tao,
its demons do not appear.

> 以道德居
位治天下
則鬼不敢
見其精神以犯人也
If one stays with Tao and Te on the throne,
thus managing the empire,
then the demons do not dare
to make their spirituality visible in order to make men rebellious.

>> V.1.: "then the demons do not dare to become offensive
by means of their spirituality".

非其鬼不神
Not only do its demons not appear;
其神不傷人
its ghosts also do not hurt men.

> 其鬼非无精神也
非不八正不能傷自然之人
Not only do its demons not show their spirituality,
but wickedness does not enter goodness and is not able to hurt the nature of the people.

>> An entirely different reading of the commentary runs thus:
When a saint is on the throne,
he does not hurt men.
Therefore the demons do not molest them.

非其神不傷人
聖人亦不傷
Not only do its demons not hurt men,
but neither does the saint hurt men.

> 非鬼神不能傷害人
以聖人在位不傷害人
Not only are its demons and spirits not able to hurt anybody,
but also by the saint on the throne nobody is hurt.
故鬼不敢干之也
Therefore the demons do not risk giving offence.

夫兩不相傷
Now when both do not hurt each other,

> 鬼與聖人
俱兩不相傷也
The demons and the saint,
both of them do not hurt each other.

故德交歸焉
then Te will unite and return.

> 夫兩不相傷
人得治於陽
鬼得治於隂
As both do not hurt each other,
man is able to govern the Yang,
and the demon is able to govern the Yin.
人得全其性命
鬼得保其精神
Man is able to fulfil his natural destiny,
and the demon is able to save his spirituality.
故德交歸焉
Therefore Te unites and returns.
