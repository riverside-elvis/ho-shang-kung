# Ch. 69 玄用 How to use the dark one.

用兵有言
For the use of weapons there is a saying:

> 陳用兵之道
This represents the principle of the use of arms.
老子疾時用兵
Lao-tse loathed the militarism of his time.
故託巳設其義也
Therefore he himself relies on its ideas.

>> The first sentence 陳用兵之道 is not clear.
It might also be translated: "This is a saying of the regular troops."
The meaning of the last sentence is:
"He wants to refute the militarists by their own arguments."

吾不敢為主
I dare not play the host

> 主先也
The host goes ahead.
不敢先舉兵
He dares not take up arms first.

>> Instead of 舉兵 "take up arms" v.1. 興 | "raise troops".

而為客
but I play the guest.

> 客者和而不倡
The guest adapts himself and does not take the lead.
用兵當承天而後動
The warrior must conform to heaven and [only] move afterwards.

不敢進寸而退尺
I dare not advance an inch but I retire a foot.

> 侵人境界
利人財寳
為進閉門
守城為退
He encroaches upon the positions of others,
he uses the riches of others,
he advances and closes the gates,
he holds the city and retires.

是謂行無行
This is called to go without going,

> 彼遂不止為天下賊
Such following without stopping makes him the empire's thief.
雖行誅之
不行執也
Though it is possible to punish him,
it is impossible to seize him.
{無行户剛反}

>> Instead of 賊 "thief" v.1. 賤 "inferior", which makes no sense.
Instead of 執 "seize" v.1. 誅 "punish", which is equally without sense.

攘無臂
to stretch without arms,

> 雖欲
大怒若無臂可攘也
Though he wants to stretch his arms,
he is as angry as if he had no arms to stretch.
{攘若羊反}

>> The characters 攘臂 "to stretch his arms" are missing in one edition.

仍無敵
to seize without arms,

> 雖欲執持之
若無兵刃可持用也
雖欲仍引之心若無敵可仍也
Though he would like to seize something,
it is as if he were handling and using a weapon without a blade.
何者傷彼之民罹罪於天
How could he hurt them and enmesh the people into sin before heaven?
遭不道之君
愍忍喪之痛也
If this happens to a prince who has no Tao,
he will not bear to lose it.

執無兵
to attract without an enemy.

> 雖欲執持之
若無兵刃可持用也
Though he would like to go and attract the hearts,
it is as if he could attract them without having an enemy.
{何者傷彼之民罹
罪於天遭不道之君
愍忍䘮之痛也}

>> 行 "to go" is wanting in one edition.

禍莫大於輕敵
No misfortune is greater than making light of the enemy.

> 夫禍亂之害莫大於欺輕敵家
Now no unfortunate confusion is greater than a deceptive underestimation of the enemy.
侵取不休輕戰{貪財}
By incessantly grasping for an underrated enemy one will lose.

輕敵
幾䘮吾寳
If one makes light of the enemy,
one is near losing the jewel of the ego.

> 幾近也
幾近也
幾 = near.
寳身也
The jewel is the body.
欺輕敵者近䘮身也
By deceptive underrating of the enemy one comes near to the loss of the body.
{幾音祈音機}

故抗兵相加
Therefore when opposed warriors measure their strength,

> 兩敵戰也
Two enemies at war.

哀者勝矣
then the compassionate one will be victorious.

> 哀者慈仁
The compassionate one is the benign and humane warrior.
士卒不逺於死
He does not come near to death.

>> Li Ch'iao doubts the correctness of the text.
He quotes a variant of the last sentence:
"Surely he will keep aloof from underrating the enemy."
The Tao-tsang edition reads:
He does not keep it away from his self.
