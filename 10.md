# Ch. 10 能為 How to be able to act.

載營魄
If one sustains the spiritual and the animal souls,

> 營魄魂魄也
營魄 = 魂魄 the spiritual and the animal souls.
人載魂魄
Man sustains the souls.
之上得以生
Thereby he makes it possible to live.
{當愛養之}
喜怒亡魂
Joy and hatred cause the spiritual soul to become lost.
卒驚傷魄
Sudden fright hurts the animal soul.
魂在肝
魄在肺
The spiritual soul is in the liver,
the animal soul in the lungs.
美酒甘肴
腐人□[^10-1]肺

spoils liver and lungs.
故魂靜
志道不亂
Therefore by keeping the spiritual soul quiet,
one strives for Tao and becomes not flurried.
魄安
得夀延年也
By leaving the animal soul in peace,
one attains a long life and prolongs one's years.

>> On Ho-shang-kung's opinion,
adopted by many commentators and a number of modern scholars,
that ying is an expression denoting the spiritual soul
(probably a word from the old language of Ch'u akin to Chinese ling 靈),
see Erkes, Arthur Waley's Laotse-Überserzung, Artibus Asiae V (1935), 296.

抱一
能無離
and embraces unity,
one may be without separation.

> 言

人能抱一使不離於身

Who embraces unity and induces it not to depart from the body,
will exist forever.
一者道
始所生太和之精氣也
Who becomes one with Tao,
first produces the atmosphere of Great Harmony.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
一布名於天下
Unity spreads its glory through the world.
天得一
以清
Heaven attained unity,
therefore it is clear.

Earth attained unity,
thereby it is peaceful.

>> Part of the commentary alludes to ch. 39.

專氣
致柔
If one concentrates the breath,
if one produces tenderness,

> 專守精氣使不乱
則形躰能應之而柔順
If one holds the breath without allowing oneself to become confused,
then the body is able to fit in with this and to become tender and pliant.

能孾兒
one may resemble a little child.

> 能如孾兒內无思慮
外無政事
則精神不去也
If one is able to resemble a little child,
inwardly without fear and outwardly without action,
then the spirits do not flee.

滌除玄覽
By purifying and cleansing one gets the dark look.

> 當洗其心使潔淨也
One must purify one's mind and let it become clear.
心居玄冥之處
覽知万事
If the mind stays in dark places,
the look knows all its doings.
故謂之玄覽也
Therefore it is called the dark look.
{滌徒歷反}

>> The "dark look" is the Taoist term
for the position of the eyes during meditation,
when they are half-closed and fixed on the point of the nose.
Ho-shang-kung seems to understand it in this sense.
--- Instead of 清潔 "to let it become clear" v.1. 潔靜, with the same meaning.

能無疵
Is one able to be without faults?

> 不滛邪也
One is without immorality.
{疵在斯反}

>> One edition adds:
{淨能无疵病乎}
"Is the purified one not able to be without faults?"

愛民
治國
In loving the people,
in governing the country,

> 治身者
愛氣
Who preaches himself asceticism,
ought to save the breath;
則身全
then the body will be complete.
治國者
愛民
Who governs a country,
ought to love the people;
則國安
then the land will be pacified.

能無知
can one be without [knowledge]?

> 治身者
呼吸精氣
无令耳闻也
Who practises asceticism,
ought to inhale and exhale the breath,
without allowing the ears to hear it.
> 治國者
布施惠德
无令下知也
Who governs a country,
ought to diffuse Te and to spread compassion,
without letting his subjects know it.

天門開闔
The gate of heaven opens and shuts.

> 天門謂北極紫㣲宫
The gate of heaven is called the purple secret palace of the north-pole.
開闔謂終始五際也
To open and shut means to end and to begin with the five junctures.
治身
天門謂鼻孔
In the practice of asceticism,
the gate of heaven means the nostrils.
開謂喘息
To open means to breathe hard;
闔謂呼吸也
to shut means to inhale and exhale.
{闔户臘反}

>> About the five junctures, 五際,
I have been unable to discover anything in the literature accessible to me.

能無雌
Can one not be a female bird?

> 治身
當如雌牝
安靜柔弱
In practising asceticism,
one must be like a female bird,
quiet and still, soft and tender.
治國
應変和而不唱
In governing a country,
one must change to harmony and not take the lead.

明白四逹
If it resplendent penetrates the four quarters,

> 言
This means:
逹明白
如日月四通
滿於天下八極之外
Tao is resplendent
like sun and moon which penetrate the four quarters
and fill the world beyond the eight poles.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
視之
不見
"If looking for it,
one does not see it;
聽之
不聞
if listening for it,
one does not hear it."
彰布之於十方
煥煥煌煌也
Within the ten quarters
it shows itself in radiant brilliance.

>> The words "if looking for it etc" are a quotation from ch. 14.
The expression she-fang 十方 "the ten quarters of the world"
is foreign to the cosmology of ancient China and points to Buddhist influence,
comp. introduction, note 16.

能無知
can one be without knowledge?

> 无有能知道滿於天下者
Nobody is able to know how Tao fills the world.

生之畜之
It generates and nourishes.

> 道生萬物而畜養之
Tao generates all things and nourishes them.

{生而不有}

> {道生万物
无所取有}

為而不恃
It acts and does not possess.

> 道所施為
不恃望其報也

it does not expect recompense for it.

是謂玄德
This is called the mysterious Te.

> 言
This means:
道行德玄冥不可得見
Tao and Te are mysterious and invisible.
欲使人如道也
The heart of the man who strives for it resembles [that of] Tao.

>> The Tao-tsang edition reads:
"A man striving for it knows Tao."
