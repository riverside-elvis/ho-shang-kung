# Ch. 5 虛用 How to use emptiness.

天地不仁

> 天地生萬物
Heaven and earth beget all beings.
人最為貴
Man is the most precious one [among them].
天地視之如芻草狗畜
[But] Heaven and earth regard him like a strawdog (or: like plants and animals).
不貴望其報也

{芻楚狗反
狗古口反}

>> The words:
"Man is the most precious one. Heaven and earth..."
are missing in a quotation in Wei Cheng's Che-yao.
If Ho-shang-kung's expression 芻草狗畜
is only an amplification of 芻狗 "strawdogs"
or to be taken as "plants and animals",
the way Wang Pi explains it, cannot be decided.
Ma Hsü-lun (Lao-tse ho-ku I, 50b) inclines to the latter view.
