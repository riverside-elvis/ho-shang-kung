# Ch. 42 道化 On the changes of Tao.

道生一
Tao generates one.
一生二
One generates two.
二生三
Two generate three.
三生萬物
Three generate all things.

> Tao generates one:
道始所生者
what Tao generates in the beginning, is one.
One generates two:
一生隂與陽也
it generates Yin and Yang.
Two generate three:
隂陽生和氣
濁
三氣
分為
天
地
人也
Yin and Yang generate the harmonious,
the clear and the turbid,
the three atmospheres
which are divided into
heaven,
earth
and man.
Three generate all beings:
天
地
共生萬物也
heaven,
earth
and man
together generate everything.
天施
地化
人長養之也
Heaven expands,
earth changes,
man educates and nourishes.

萬物負隂而抱陽
All things turn away from Yin and embrace Yang.

> 萬物无不負隂而向陽
Among all things there is none which did not turn away from Yin and embrace Yang.
廻心而就日
They improve on the same day.

>> Instead of 抱, "embrace" v.1. 向 "turn towards".

冲氣以為和
The empty breath effects union.

> 萬物中皆有元氣
In all things there is the original breath.
得以和柔
若胷中有藏
骨中有髓
草木中有空虛
Thereby they reach their union with weakness,
as within the breast there are the intestines,
within the bones there is the marrow,
within plants there is emptiness.
與氣通
The harmonious breath secretly pervades them.
故得久生也
Thereby they obtain long life.

人之所惡
唯孤
寡
不轂
What is odious to men,
that are orphans,
widows
and "naveless ones".
而王公以為稱
But king and dukes take these for their designations.

> 孤
寡
不轂者
不祥之名
而王公以為稱者
Orphan,
widow
and "naveless one"
are unlucky names,
but the princes and the king take them for their designations.
處謙卑
法虛空和柔
Remain in humility,
take emptiness for your model and become united to weakness.
{惡烏路反
稱尺證反}

>> On the title pu-ku "naveless one" see note on ch. 39.

故物或損之而益
Thereby some of the creatures lose it and win,

> 引之
不得
By attracting it,
it is not won.
推之
必還
If repelled,
it is sure to return.

>> Instead of 引 "to attract" v.1. 取 "to seize".
Instead of 推之 "if repelled" v.1. | 讓 "if declined".
One edition adds a quotation from Wen-tse,
doubtless a later addition,
as Ho-shang-kung never quotes another author by name.

或益之而損
win it and lose.

> 夫増髙者
崩
Who exalts himself,
breaks down.
貪富者
致患
Who strives for riches,
gets into misfortune.

>> Instead of 致 "gets into" v.1. 得 "attains".

人之所教
What others teach,

> 謂衆人所以教
去弱為強
去柔為剛
This means the teachings of others
with regard to the flight from weakness and the practice of strength,
the flight from tenderness and the practice of hardness.

我亦教之
I teach it too.

> 言
He says:
我教衆人
使去強為弱
去剛為柔
I teach men
to flee from strength and to practise weakness,
to flee from hardness and to practise tenderness.

強梁者不得其死
The violent ones do not reach their [natural] death.

> 強梁謂不信玄妙背叛道徳
The violent ones are those who do not believe in the mystery and rebel against Tao and Te.
不從經教
尚勢任力也
They do not follow the classical doctrines,
honour power and use violence.
不得其死者
為天所絶
They do not reach their [natural] death,
because heaven cuts off [their life].
兵刃所伐
王法所殺
Weapons attack them,
the king's law kills them.
不得以壽命死也
They do not reach the [natural] death of their life.

>> V.1.: "they do not reach the end of their life but die".
Ching-chiao is perhaps not to be understood in its general meaning
"doctrine of the classics" but as "doctrine of the Ching"
i.e. the Tao-te-ching, such as Han Fei
always calls the Tao-te-ching 書 shu "the Book",
a designation otherwhere only applied to the Shu-ching.

吾將以為教父
I want to make these the fathers of my doctrine.

> 父始也
The father is the beginning.
老子以強梁之人為敎戒之始也
Lao-tse makes of the men of violence the beginning of the commandments of his doctrine.

>> Instead of 戒 "commandments" v.1. 式 "model", rejected by Li Ch'iao.
