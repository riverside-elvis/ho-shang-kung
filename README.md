# Appendix: Transcriber's notes

This is a mashup of
[ctext](https://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&res=77449)'s
*Sibu congkan* base text
and Eduard Erkes' translation of the Heshang gong commentary
of the _Laozi_ in
_Ho-Shang-Kung: Ho-Shang-Kung's commentary on Lao-Tse._
Translated and annotated by Eduard Erkes, 1958.

Erkes used the Li Ch'iao edition as his base text,
which differs in places from *Sibu congkan*.
Significant differences are in curly braces,
including in a few of Erkes' notes
where he translates variations without including base text.

English typos are probably also in the original.
