# Ch. 33 辯德 How to discriminate Te.

知人者智

Who knows men is wise.

> 能知人好惡
是為智
Who is able to know the love and hatred of men,
that one is wise.

>> Instead of 爲智 "is wise" v.1. 有智 "has wisdom".

自知者明
Who knows himself is enlightened.

> 人能自知賢不肖
是為反聽無聲
內視無形
If a man is able to know his own worthiness and unworthiness,
this means that he reversely hears the soundless
and internally perceives the shapeless.
故為明
Therefore he is called enlightened.

勝人者有力
Who vanquishes others possesses strength.

> 能勝人者
不過以威力也
Who is able to vanquish others,
only manages it by force.

自勝者強
Who vanquishes himself is strong.

> 人能自勝巳情欲
則天下無有能與己尹者
If a man is able to vanquish the desires of his own character,
then nobody in the world can fight him.
故為強
Therefore he is strong.

知足者富
Who knows contentedness is rich.

> 人能知足之為足
則長保福禄
Who is able to know what forms the contentedness of contentedness,
will long retain luck and prosperity.
故為富也
Therefore he is esteemed.

>> Ho-shang-kung's reading 貴 "esteemed"
presupposes a similar wording of the text he commented upon.
The present reading is implied by the following variant:
"Who knows contentedness, retains luck and prosperity for long.
Therefore he will be rich".
Wei Cheng quotes the beginning of the commentary thus:
"Who is able to know what is contentedness ...".

強行者有志
Who forces his doings has intentions.

> 人能強力行善則為有意於道
Who forces himself to do good deeds has intentions on Tao.
道亦有意於人
And Tao has also intentions on him.

>> Instead of 志 "intentions" v.1. 意 with the same meaning.
The second sentence is missing in Wei Cheng's quotation.
On the personal conception of Tao which here appears again,
see notes on ch. 23.

不失其所者久
Who does not lose his place is permanent.

> 人能自節養
不失其所
Who is able to nourish himself by moderation,
does not lose his place.
受天之精氣則可以久
By receiving the essential breath of heaven he is able to endure.

□[^33-1]而不亡者壽
Who dies without perishing is long-lived.

> 目不妄視
耳不妄聽
口不妄言
則无怨惡於天下
If the eyes do not lose sight,
if the ears do not lose hearing,
if the mouth does not lose the language,
then one is not hated by the empire.
故長壽
Therefore one is able to live long.

>> V.1s. "Therefore one has long life"
and "Therefore one has no long life".
The latter reading is of course wrong.
