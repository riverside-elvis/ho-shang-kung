# Ch. 18 俗薄 On the superficiality of the vulgar.

大道廢
有仁義
When the great Tao decays,
there is humanity and justice.

> 大道之時家有孝子
户有忠信
仁義
不見也
In the time of the Great Tao there are filial sons within the family,
and in the country there are faith and sincerity,
humanity and justice,
but they remain invisible.
大道廢不用
惡逆生
When the Great Tao decays,
then hatred and rebellion arise.
乃有仁義
{可}傳道
Then humanity and justice are there,
and Tao is no longer transmitted.

>> The Tao-tsang edition reads
見也 "they are visible"
instead of 不見也 "they remain invisible",
which doubtless is only a misprint.
Instead of "decays" v.1. "decays and is not used".
Instead of 不傅道 "Tao is no longer transmitted"
v.1. 可 | | "one could talk about it".

智惠出
有大偽
Where wisdom and benevolence appear,
there is great hypocrisy.

> 智惠之君賤德而貴言
A wise and benevolent prince thinks little of Te and much of words.
賤質而貴文
He thinks little of reality and much of appearances.
下則應之以為大偽姦詐
His subjects correspond to this by being very hypocritical and deceitful.

六親不和
有孝慈
When the six degrees of relationship are not in harmony,
there is piety and benevolence.

> 六絶絶
親戚不和
If the six threads are torn,
relatives are no longer in harmony.
乃有孝慈相牧養也
Then there is piety and benevolence so that they may nourish each other.

>> The Tao-tsang edition reads
instead of "the six threads":
"the six degrees of relationship".

國家昬亂
有忠臣
When state and family are in disorder,
then there are loyal ministers.

> 政令不行
上下相怨
When the government is not kept going,
prince and subjects hate each other.
邪僻爭權
乃有忠臣匡正其君也
When bad princes vie with each other for power,
then there are loyal ministers to correct their princes.
此言
This means:
天下太平不知仁
When there is general peace in the world then nothing is known about humanity and justice.
人盡無欲
不知廉
Nobody wants anything,
and honesty is unknown.
各㓗已
不知貞
Of one's own accord one keeps pure,
and chastity is unknown.
大道之君
仁義没
孝慈滅
猶日中盛時衆星失光
When under the domination of the Great Tao
humanity and justice vanish
and piety and benevolence disappear,
this is like the stars' losing their splendour when the sun has fully risen.

>> After "and chastity is unknown" one edition adds:
"Everybody remains true to himself, and sincerity is unknown."
Instead of "When under the domination of the Great Tao ... disappear"
the Tao-tsang edition reads:
"Therefore, when in the world of the Great Tao
piety and benevolence disappear and humanity and justice vanish".
