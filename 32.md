# Ch. 32 聖德 On the Te of the saint.

道常無名
Tao is eternally without a name.

> 道能隂能陽
能施能張
能存能亡
Tao may be Yin or Yang,
may grow or decline,
may exist or perish.
故無常名也
Therefore it is without a constant name.

>> The last explanation, 無常名, is rather curious, as the text has 常無名.
Probably Ho-shang-kung's text
had originally the same wording as the commentary,
as is also supposed by Ma Hsü-lun, Lao-tse ho-ku I, 137b.

朴雖小
It is simple though small.
天下不敢臣
In the empire nobody dares to serve it.

> 道朴雖小
微
妙
無形
Tao is simple though small,
subtle,
mysterious
and shapeless.
天下不敢有臣使道者也
Within the empire nobody risks to be a servant serving Tao.

侯王若能守之
萬物將自賔
If the princes and the king were able to serve it,
everything would spontaneously submit.

> 侯王若能守道无為
萬物將自賔服從於德也
If the princes and the king were able to retain Tao and non-action,
everything would spontaneously submit and follow the changes of Te.

天地相合以降甘露
Heaven and earth would unite to send down the sweet dew.

> 侯王動作能與天相應合
天即下甘露善瑞也
If the princes and the king are able to adapt themselves in their doings to the changes of heaven and earth,
then heaven sends down sweet dew as a good omen.

民
莫之令
而自均
As to the people,
if nobody orders them about,
they are of themselves equal.

> 天降善瑞
則萬物莫有教令之者皆自均調若一也
If heaven sends down favourable omina,
then the creatures have nobody to govern them and become of themselves equal as if they were unified.

>> Instead of 嘉 "favourable" v.1. 善 "good".

始制有名
The beginning rules those having names.

> 始道也
The beginning is Tao.
有名萬物也
Those having names are the creatures.
道無名
能制於有名
Tao, as having no name,
is able to govern those that have names.
無形能制於有形也
What is shapeless entirely rules what is shaped.

名亦旣有
Names also exhaust existence.

> 既盡也
既 = 盡 to exhaust.
有名之物
盡有
The things, as they have names,
are exhausted through their existence.
情欲叛道離德
Their essence strives to rebel against Tao and to become separated from Te.
故身毀辱也
Thereby their bodies are ruined and defiled.

天亦將知之
Heaven will also know when to stop.

> 人能去道行德
天亦將自知之
If man is able to take Tao for his model and to follow Te,
heaven will also of itself know when to stop.

>> Instead of 法 "model" there is the senseless reading 譌 "wrongly".
Instead of 知止 "to know when to stop" v.1. 知之 "know it",
which conforms to a similar variant of Lao-tse's text.

知之
所以不殆
If it knows when to stop,
then there will be no danger.

> 天知之
則神靈祐助不復危殆
If heaven knows when to stop,
then the magical power of the spirits is preserved and not endangered.

>> Instead of 天 "heaven" v.1. 夫 "now if one knows when to stop".
Instead of 止 "to stop" v.1. 之 "by knowing this",
which again follows a different reading of the text.

譬道之在天下猶川谷之與江海
Tao's existence in the world may be compared to the relations of the rivers and torrents to the [Yang-tse-]chiang and the sea.

> 言
This means:
道之在天下與人
相應和如川谷與江海
相流通也
Tao's relations within the world to man
correspond to the harmony with which rivers and torrents
mutually mingle their floods with the [Yang-tse-]chiang and the sea.
