# Ch. 4 無源 What has no origin.

道冲
而用之
Tao is within,
and if it is used,

> 冲中也
ch'ung 冲 = chung 中 within.
道匿名藏譽
Tao hides its name and conceals its praise.
其用在中
Its use is within.
In one school it is said:
Tao becomes useful by being harmonious within.
Therefore it is said "within".
{冲直隆反}

>> The provenance of this quotation is not to be ascertained.

或不盈
it is always not full.

> 或常也
或 = 常 always.
道常謙虛不盈滿
Tao is always modest and not conceited.

淵乎似萬物之宗
An abyss, o! like the ancestor of all things.

> 道淵深不可知也
似為萬物之宗祖
Tao is deep like an abyss and unknowable,
as if it were the ancestor of all things.

挫其銳
Stop these approaches.

> 挫 = 止 to stop.
銳進也
銳 = 進 to approach.
人欲銳精進取功名
Man wishes to approach the essence and to acquire merit and glory.
當挫上之
He ought to stop this.
法道不自也
Law and Tao are themselves not visible.
{挫子卧反
銳恱歲反}

>> Instead of 精 "essence" v.1. 情 "feelings".
Li Ch'iao puts this variant into the text,
though it gives a less good meaning.
Another variant 愼 "cautiousness, sincerity" is doubtless to be rejected.
Instead of 自見 "themselves visible"
there are variants 同 "identical"
and 自見同 "themselves visibly identical".
Law (fa), appearing in the last sentence before Tao,
might be its Buddhist equivalent Dharma
and so conceivably point to Buddhist influence.
--- Compare the largely varying explanations
given in ch. 56 of this sentence and the three next ones.

解其紛
Loosen these connections.

> 紛結恨也
紛 = bound to hatred.
當念道无為
Remember Tao and non-action.
以解釋
Thereby they will be loosened.
{紛拂云反}

>> Instead of 恨 "hatred" v.1. 根 "root", rightly rejected by Li Ch'iao.

和其光
Harmonize this splendour.

> 言雖
This means:
有獨見之明
當知闇昧
不當以擢亂人也
Though you have the light of unique insight,
you ought to know darkness
and not to irritate others by your splendour.

同其塵
Become one with this dust.

> 常與衆庻
同垢塵
不當自别殊
You ought to side with the masses,
to unite yourself with dust
and not to keep aloof.

湛兮似若存
湛□[^04-1]似若存
Still, o! as if enduring.

> 言當湛然安靜
This means that one ought to remain quite still and peaceful.
故能長存不亡
Then one is able to endure long without perishing.
{湛直減反}

吾不知誰之子
I do not know whose child it is.

> 老子言
Lao-tse says:
我不知道所從生
I do not know where Tao came from.

象帝之先
It seems to have preceded Ti.

> 道自在天帝之前
Tao was even there before the God of heaven.
此言
This means:
道乃先天地生也
Tao thus preceded the birth of the God of heaven.
至今在者
以能安
靜
湛然
不勞煩
That it exists down to present times,
is because it is able to be peaceful,
quiet
and still
without troubling.
欲使人修身法道
It wants to induce man to perfect himself and to take Tao for his model.

>> Ho-shang-kung seems to allude to
an otherwise unknown myth of the birth of Shang-ti
(from a primeval goddess? Tao itself?)
But a variant not given by Li Ch'iao
but contained in the Tao-tsang edition runs thus:
道乃先天地生
"Tao thus preceded the birth of heaven and earth"
which would merely be an allusion to ch. 25.
