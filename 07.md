# Ch. 7 韜光 On the dawning splendour.

天長地乆
Heaven and earth are enduring and lasting.

> 說天地長生乆壽
以喻教人也
This wants to say that heaven and earth are of long existence and permanent living,
whereby they teach man.

天地所以能長且乆者
以其不自生
Whereby heaven and earth are able to endure and besides this to last,
is through their not living for themselves.

> 天地所以獨長且乆者
以其安靜
Whereby heaven and earth alone endure and last,
is their quietness.
施不榮報
不如人居處汲汲求自饒之利
In giving they do not expect recompense,
unlike man who strives in haste to enrich himself.
奪人以自與
They use man in order to help him.

故能長生
Thereby they are able to live long.

> 以其不求生
故能長生不終也
Because they do not strive for life,
they are able to live long and never to end.

是以聖人後其身
Therefore the saint puts his person behind,

> 先人而後己者也
He allows others to go ahead and puts himself last.

而身先
and his person comes to the front.

> 天下敬之
In the world he is honoured.
先以為長
He goes ahead and thereby becomes superior.

外其身
He puts his person aside,

> 薄己而厚人也
He thinks little of himself and loves others.

而身存
and his person remains.

> 百姓愛之如父母
All the people love him like their father and mother.
神明祐之若赤子
The spirits protect him like a little child.
故身常存
Therefore his person continues to remain.

非以其無私邪
Is this not because he has no egoism?

> 聖人為人所愛神明所祐
The saint is loved by men and protected by the spirits.
非以其公正無私所致乎
Is this not because he reigns with justice and unselfishness?

故能成其私
Thereby he is able to fulfil his egoism.

> 人以為私者欲以厚己也
Men by being egoistic want to achieve fulness.
聖人无私而己自厚
The saint is no egoist but achieves fulness spontaneously.
故能成其私也
Therefore he is able to fulfil his egoism.
