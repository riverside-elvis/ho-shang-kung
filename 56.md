# Ch. 56 玄德 On mysterious Te.

知者不言
The knowing one does not talk.

> 知者貴行不貴言也
The knowing one esteems deeds and not words.

>> Instead of "deeds" v.1. "his doings".
The Tao-tsang edition reads:
"The knowing one esteems walking in Tao;
he does not esteem words."

言者不知
The talker knows nothing.

> 駟不及舌
A quadriga does not catch the tongue.
多言多患
Who talks much, will have much sorrow.

>> The Tao-tsang edition inverts the sequence of the sentences.
The sentence "A quadriga does not catch the tongue"
is a quotation from Lun-yü 12, 8.

塞其兊
閉其門
Stop up these openings,
bar this gate.

> 塞門之者
欲絶其源
Who stops them up and bars them,
wants to cut off his sources.

> 情欲有所銳為

當念道無為

以挫止之

{挫子卧反}

>> Comp. the entirely different explanations given of this sentence
and the three following ones in ch. 4
which also necessitate a partially different translation
of the accompanying text of Lao-tse.

解其紛
Sever this connection.

> 紛結恨不休
當念道無為
If the connection with hatred does not cease,
one must think of Tao and non-action.
以挫止之
Thereby it will be severed.

>> Instead of 無爲 "non-action" v.1. 淡泊 "quietness".

和其光

> 雖有獨見之明
當和之

you must harmonize it.

是謂玄同
This is called the union with the dark one.

> 玄天也
The dark one is heaven.
人能行此上事
是謂與天同道也
If man is able to do these superior deeds,
this means that he together with heaven will become united to Tao.

on Huai-nan-tse 16, 7b, comp. the introduction and note on ch. 1.
