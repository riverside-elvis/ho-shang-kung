益生日祥
By fulfilling life one becomes daily more happy.

> 祥長也
Happiness endures.
言益生欲自生日以長大
To fulfil life means daily to increase the wish for long life.

>> The Tao-tsang edition reads 曰 "is called" instead of 日 "daily",
thus giving the meaning: "To fulfil life is called happiness",
as Wang Pi gives the text and as it is quoted by Huai-nan-tse 12, 9b.
But Ho-shang-kung's explanation seems to presuppose the text as it stands
and is given by Li Ch'iao.
The same is the case with the following sentence.

心使氣日强
The heart causes the breath to become daily stronger.

> 心當専一和柔
而氣實內
The heart must especially harmonize tenderness,
then the breath really dwells in it.
故形柔
Therefore the appearance is tender.
而反
使妄有所為
和氣去於中
But if, contrary to this,
wrong things are caused to be done,
then the harmonious breath disappears from the interior.
故形體日以剛強也
Therefore the body becomes daily harder.

>> See the foregoing explanation.
--- The Tao-tsang edition closes the chapter here
and begins ch. 56 with the following sentence.

物壯將老
Things grow and then become old.
謂之不道
This is called without Tao.

> 萬物壯極
則枯老也
When things have reached the acme of growth,
then they wither and become old.
老
不得道
That which is withered and old
has not reached Tao.

>> 則 "that" and 枯 "withered" are missing in one edition.

不道早巳
Without Tao one soon ends.

> 不得道者
早巳死也
Who does not reach Tao,
ends soon by death.
