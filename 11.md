# Ch. 11 無用 How to make use of non-existence.

三十輻共一轂
Thirty spokes unite in one nave.

> 古者車三十輻
法月數也
In ancient times, the wheels had thirty spokes,
corresponding to the number of the moon (month).
共一轂者
轂中有孔
They unite in one nave,
as the nave is empty within.
故衆輻共湊之
Therefore all the spokes unite there.
治身者當除情
去欲
使五藏空虛
Who practises asceticism must get rid of the feelings,
do away with the desires
and cause the five viscera to be empty.
神乃歸之也
Then the spirits return there.
治國者寡能
揔衆弱共使強
Who governs a country, if he alone is able to keep the masses together,
then the weak may protect the strong.
{輻音福
轂古木反}

>> On the thirty spokes of the wheels of ancient China,
comp. Chou-li 12, 23a (K'ao-kung-chi)
and the commentary of the Ch'ien-lung edition
quoted in Biot, Le Tcheou-li, II, 557, n. 5,
where it is explained that this number was conditioned
by the diameter of the wheel.
It is mentioned by other old writers;
Wen-tse 6, 7a: "the nave is empty but fixes in itself the thirty spokes";
Huai-nan-tse 17, 13a: "the nave fixes the thirty spokes".
A fragment of Yen Chün-p'ing's commentary (Han time),
preserved by Ku Huan and reproduced by Li Ch'iao (I, 14b)
gives an explanation similar to that of Ho-shang-kung.
The statement made by Richard Wilhelm,
Geschichte der chinesischen Kultur, p. 51:
"the wheel that perhaps originally had thirty spokes
according to the number of the days of the month was the solar wheel"
seems to be based on a slight misunderstanding of Ho-shang-kung's explanation.

當其無有車之用
Through what it has not the wheel can be used.

> 无謂空虚
Not-speaking is emptiness.
轂中空虚車得去行
Through the nave's being empty the wheel is able to move.
轝中空虚人能載其上也
Through the carriage's being empty man is able to ride in it.
{當丁浪反}

埏埴以為器
Of suitable clay vessels are made.

> 埏和也
埏 = 和 suitable.
埴土也
埴 = 土.
和土以為飲食之器
Of suitable clay eating and drinking vessels are made.
{埏始然反
埴市力反}

>> Li Ch'iao quotes Lu Te-ming who explains Ho-shang-kung's definition 和,
lit. "harmonious" by 正和 "suitable".
Comp. Ma Hsü-lun, Lao-tse ho-ku I, 64b.

當其無有器之用
Through what it has not a vessel can be used.

> 器中空虚
A vessel is empty within.
故得有所盛受
Thereby it can be used.

鑿户牖以為室
By piercing doors and windows rooms are made.

> 謂作屋室
This means that rooms are made...

>> Evidently part of the commentary is missing.

當其無有室之用
Through what it has not a room can be used.

> 言
This means:
户牖空虚
人得以出入觀視
Doors and windows are empty,
so that men may leave and enter and look through them.
室中空虚
人得以居處
The room is empty,
so that men are able to inhabit it.
是其用
In this its usefulness consists.

故有之以為利
Therefore existence is advantageous.

> 利物也利於形用
The thing is more useful than the appearance.
器中有物
If there are things in a vessel,
it is to be feared that the vessel will be broken
室中有人
恐其屋破壞
If there are men in a room,
it is to be feared that the room will break down.
腹中有神
畏形之消亡也
If there are spirits in the belly,
it is to be feared that the form will vanish.

>> The text is evidently corrupt,
as the commentary of the Ching-lun-t'ang edition,
quoted by Li Ch'iao, remarks.
In the Tao-tsang edition, the first sentence is given as
利物也.
利形於用,
which makes no sense. Of the second sentence,
the second half is evidently lost and to be restored as given above.
The last sentence seems hopelessly corrupt.

無之以為用
Non-existence is useful.

> 言
This means:
虚空者乃可用盛受萬物
Emptiness may thus make use of the spirits to receive all things.
故曰
Therefore it is said:
虚无能制有形
Empty nothingness is able to work on the existing forms.
道者空也
Tao is empty.

>> The first sentence is given by Li Ch'iao after the Ching-lun-t'ang edition.
The Tao-tsang edition reads:
Emptiness is called filled and [yet] receiving all things.
