# Ch. 13 厭恥 How to loathe shame.

寵辱若驚
Inclination and disinclination are like fear.

> 身寵亦驚
身辱亦驚
Bodily inclination is like fear,
and bodily disinclination is also like fear.

貴大患若身
One is afraid that great anxiety might reach the body.

> 貴畏也
貴 kuei (honour) = 畏 wei to be afraid.
若至也
若 jo (like) = 至 che to reach.
畏大患至身
One is afraid of great anxiety that may reach the body.
故皆驚
Therefore there is fear.

>> V.1.: Therefore everything is fear.
--- It need hardly be said that the explanations of kuei = wei
and of jo = che are entirely arbitrary
and without any linguistic or material foundation.

何謂寵辱
What means inclination and disinclination?

> 問何為寵何為辱
He asks wherein inclination and disinclination consist.
寵者尊榮
Inclination is honour.
辱者恥辱及身
Disinclination is shame touching the body.
還自問者以曉人也
By once more asking himself he enlightens others.

>> Instead of ju "shame" one edition has 補 pu "help",
evidently a mere misprint.

辱為下
Inclination effects humiliation.

> 辱為下賤
Inclination and disinclination effect humiliation and slightening.

>> After Li Ch'iao, ch'ung "inclination"
is missing in the Ching-lun-t'ang edition.
If this reading is correct, the original text of Ho-shang-kung
must have run ju wei hsia "disinclination effects humiliation".
The text as given by Li Ch'iao must be wrong at all events,
the current reading presupposing the wording ch'ung ju wei hsia
"inclination and disinclination effect humiliation".
In the Tao-tsang edition,
the text of Lao-tse runs "disinclination effects humiliation"
and that of Ho-shang-kung "disinclination effects humiliation and slightening".
Comp. Ma Hsü-lun, Lao-tse ho-ku I, 67a.

故貴以身為天下者

Therefore if one esteems the body when governing the empire,
one may temporarily be entrusted with the empire.

This means:
人君貴其身而賤人欲為天下主者
則可寄立不可以久也
If a prince who esteems his own personality and despises the people wants to become ruler of the empire,
he may be temporarily enthroned but will not last.
{為于僞反}

愛以身為天下者
乃可以託於天下
If one loves the body when governing the empire,
one may be constantly entrusted with the empire.

> 言
This means:
人君能愛其身非為己也
乃欲為萬民之父母
If a prince is able to love his personality without caring for himself,
then he wants to become father and mother of the people.
以此得為天下主者
By achieving this he will become ruler of the empire.
乃可以託其身於萬民之上長无咎也
Then he may entrust his person to the elders of the people without making mistakes.
