# Ch. 15 顯德 How to display Te.

古之善為士者
Those of yore who ably were masters

> 謂得道之君也
This means the superior men who attained Tao.

>> Li Ch'iao thinks,
as well as Ma Hsü-lun (Lao-tse ho-ku I, 75a/b)
and Kao Heng (Lao-tse cheng-ku I, 18a/b),
that Ho-shang-kung's text originally had the wording
善爲道者 "those who ably fulfilled Tao"
instead of 善爲士者,
as a quotation in the commentary of the Hou Han-shu 97,
6b (Tang-ku-chuan) shows.
The same may be gathered from an allusion in Wen-tse 3, 2a
which runs thus: 古之爲道者理情 etc.

微妙玄通
[where] subtle and mysterious, [thus] penetrating the dark one.

> 玄天也
The dark one is heaven.
言
This means:
其志節玄妙精與天通也
Their will was the mysterious essence of the dark one by heavenly penetration.

>> On the explanation of hsüan as "heaven" see note on ch. 1.

深不可識
The depth cannot be fathomed.

> 道德深逺
Tao and Te are deep and wide.
不可識知
They cannot be understood and known.
內視若盲
反聽若聾
Inner sight is like blind,
listening back is like deaf.
莫知所長
Nobody knows what endures.

夫唯不可識
故強為之容
Now as it cannot be fathomed,
therefore I endeavour to make it accessible.

> 謂下句也
These permutations of unity are expressed in the following sentence.
{强其文反}

>> V.1.: This is expressed in the following sentence.
--- The meaning of 容 jung,
here tentatively translated by "accessible" is obscure,
and that Ho-shang-kung does not try to explain it
seems to show that he was at a loss to devise a plausible explanation,
which is the more remarkable as he is generally very ready
with arbitrary interpretations of difficult expressions.
Probably jung is a word from the Ch'u dialect the meaning of which is lost.

與□[^15-1]若冬渉川
Cautious like crossing a stream in winter.

> 舉事輙加重愼與
與□若冬渉川
In difficult undertakings one ought to be cautious,
o, like a man who crosses a stream in winter.
心猶難之也
Within one's heart one ought to think it difficult.

猶□若畏四隣
Suspicious like afraid of the four neighbours.

> 其進退猶猶
如拘制
若人犯法畏四鄰知之也
Such as these approach quite full of fear,
as if they adhered to a rule,
like somebody who transgresses the law and is afraid of his four neighbours whom he knows.

儼□其若客
Reticent like a guest.
{儼魚撿反}

> 如客畏主人
儼然無所造作也
Like a guest who stands in awe of the master of the house,
thus being reticent without doing anything.

渙□若冰之將釋
Dissolving like ice that is going to melt.

> 渙者
解散
What dissolves,
breaks up.
釋者
消亡
What melts,
vanishes.
除情去欲
日以空虚
By doing away with the feelings and getting rid of the desires,
one daily becomes more empty.

敦□其若朴
Simple like unworked wood.

> 敦者質厚
What is simple is material and firm.
朴者形未分
The form of unworked wood is not yet carved.
內守精神
外無文采也
Within one ought to take care of the spirits,
outwards one ought not to be pretentious.
{朴普角反}

曠□其若谷
Empty like a valley.

> 曠者寛大
Emptiness is wide and vast.
谷者空虛
不有德功名
無所
A valley is empty,
without Te and merit and fame,
without a place.
不包也
One does not grasp its existence.

>> Instead of
不包有
"one does not grasp its existence"
the Tao-tsang edition reads
| | 也
"one does not grasp it".
Li Ch'iao remarks that in ch. 26 of the Hus-yen-ching yin-i
the first sentence of the commentary is quoted as
曠廣大也.
The meaning remains the same.

渾□
其若濁
Muddy, o,
like turbid water.

> 渾者守舉真
Muddiness keeps its original purity.
濁者不照然也
Turbid water is not so bright.
與衆合同
不自尊
One ought to unite with the crowd
and not to keep apart.

Turbid water by being quieted gradually becomes clear.

> To quiet means to bring to a standstill.
水之濁
止而淨之
徐徐自清也
If water is turbid,
one should bring it to a standstill and quiet it,
and gradually it will become clear of itself.

>> Text and commentary as given by Li Ch'iao.
The ordinary reading of the text is:
{孰能濁以靜之徐清}
"Who is able gradually to clear the turbid by quieting it"
(Tao-tsang edition:
"by bringing it to a standstill and quieting it").
The accompanying commentary runs thus:
{孰誰也誰能知...}
"Who is able to find out how the turbid state of the water
is brought to a standstill and quieted?"

The quiet by moving it gradually becomes quickened.

{誰能安靜以久徐徐以長生也}
> Who is able to quicken the quiet slowly and gradually?

>> In the Tao-tsang edition,
the text of Lao-tse runs parallel to the foregoing line:
{孰能安以久動之徐生}
"Who is able to move the quiet by gradually quickening it?"

保此道者不欲盈
Who keeps this Tao does not want fulness.

> 保此徐生之道不欲奢泰盈溢
Who keeps this Tao of gradual living wants no luxurious fulness.

夫惟不盈
故能蔽不新成
Now who is without fulness,
is thereby able to become worn out without being newly mended.

> 夫唯不盈滿之人能守蔽不為新成
Who is now a man without fulness is able to keep his outwornness without being in need of new mending.
蔽者匿光榮也
新成者貴功名
Who is outworn hides the splendour,
who is newly mended honours merit and glory.
