# Ch. 78 任信 How to trust in sincerity.

天下柔弱莫過於水
Within the world nothing surpasses water in tenderness and weakness.

> This means:
water is pliable and soft.
圓中則圓
方中則方
Within a round [basin] it becomes round,
within a square one square.
擁之
則止
If dammed in,
it stays.
决之
則行
If let off,
it moves.

>> The first sentence is missing in one edition.
Instead of 壅 "dammed in" v.1. 擁 "stopped up", rejected by Li Ch'iao.
--- Comp. notes on ch. 8.

而攻堅強者
莫知能勝
But when it attacks what is firm and strong,
nothing is able to vanquish it.

> 水能懐山
襄陵
磨鐵
消銅
Water is able to embrace mountains,
to move hills,
to grind iron
and to dissolve copper.
莫能勝水而成功也
But nothing is able to achieve the merit of vanquishing water.

{其無以易之}

> {夫攻堅強者
無以易於水
易入聲}

弱之勝強
柔之勝剛
That the weak vanquishes the strong,
that the pliable vanquishes the unbending,

> 水能滅火
陰能消陽
Water is able to annihilate fire,
Yin is able to dissolve Yang.
舌柔
齒剛
齒先舌亡
The tongue is weak,
the teeth are strong,
but the teeth perish before the tongue.

天下莫不知
everybody in the empire knows.

> 知柔弱者長久
Who knows weakness is enduring.
剛強者折傷也
Who keeps long to strength will be hurt.

>> Instead of 長 "long" v.1. 久 "permanently".

莫能行
[But] nobody is able to act [according to it].

> 恥謙卑好強梁
Who is ashamed of humility likes to be arrogant.

故聖人云
Therefore a saint says:

> 謂下事也
The following exposition is meant.

受國之垢是謂社稷主
Who loves the dirt of the country is called lord of the altars.

> 君能愛國垢濁者
若江海不逆小流
則能長保其社稷為一國君主也
If a prince is able to take up the dirt of his country,
like the [Yang-tse-]chiang and the sea which are not opposed to the small watercourses,
then he is able to protect his altars and to become lord of the united empire.
{垢古口反}

>> Instead of 人君 "prince" v.1. 君, same meaning.
Instead of 細 "small" v.1. 小, the same.
Instead of 則 "then" v.1. 卽, the same.

受國之不祥是謂天下王
Who loves the misfortune of the country is called king of the empire.

> 君能引過自與
代民
If a ruler is able to take [the responsibility for] mistakes upon himself,
then he himself becomes the substitute for his people.
受不祥之殃
則可以王有天下
If he takes misfortune upon himself,
he may possess the empire as a king.

>> Instead of 人君 "prince" v.1. 君 the same.

正言若反
Correct words seem perverted.

> 此乃正直之言
These are thus the correct words.
世人不知
The men of the world do not know this.
以為反言
Therefore they think them perverted.
