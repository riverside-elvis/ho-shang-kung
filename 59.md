治人
When governing the people,

治身者
當愛精氣
Who practises asceticism,
must love semen and breath.
不放𨓜

{嗇生力反}

>> V.1s. 嗇 = 愛 to love, and | = 愛惜, to use sparingly.
The latter is rejected by Li Ch'iao.

夫唯嗇是謂早服
Now to covet means to acquire in time.

> 早先也
早 = 先 in time.
服得也
服 = 得 to acquire.
{夫獨愛民財}
When the riches of the people are sparingly used,
then men are peaceful.
愛精氣
則能先得天道也
When semen and breath are sparingly used,
then the Tao of heaven may be acquired in time.

早服
謂之重積德
To acquire in time,
this means to make amassed Te heavy.

> 先得天道是謂重積德於己也
To acquire the Tao of heaven in time means to put stress on Te amassed within the self.
{重直容反}

重積德
則無不剋
When one makes amassed Te heavy,
then nothing is invincible.

> 剋勝也
克 = 勝 to vanquish.
重積德於己
則无不勝
When stress is put on Te amassed in the self,
then everything may be vanquished.

無不剋
則莫知其極
When nothing is invincible,
then nobody knows his limits.

> 無不剋勝
則莫有知己德之窮極也
When nothing is invincible,
then nobody knows that the limits of his own Te might be restricted.

莫知其極
可以有國
When nobody knows his limits,
he may thereby own the country.

> 莫知己徳有極
則可以有社稷為民致福
When nobody knows his own Te to have limits,
he thereby may own a country and make the people happy.

>> Instead of 國 "a country" v.1. 社稷 "the spirits of the land".

有國之母
可以長久
When one owns the mother of the country,
he may thereby last long.

> 國身同也
The country is identical with the body.
母道也
The mother is Tao.
人能保身中之道
使精氣不勞五神不苦
When a man is able to protect Tao within the body,
he thereby causes his breath not to become heavy and the five spirits [of the viscera] not to become troubled.
則可以長久
Then he is able to last long.

>> Instead of 久 "to last" v.1. 生 "to live".

是謂深根固□[^59-1]
This is called the deep-going root and the firm trunk.

> 人能以氣為根以精為蒂
Man may regard the breath as the root and the semen as the trunk.
如樹根不深
則枝
When the roots of a tree do not reach deeply down,
it will be disrooted.
蔕不堅
則落
When the trunk is not firm,
it will fall.
言
This means:
當深藏其氣
固守其精
使無漏泄
Hide your breath deeply,
keep your semen firmly,
and do not let them leak out.
{蔕丁計反}

>> Instead of 蒂 "trunk" v.1. 蔕, the same.
Instead of --- "do not let them leak out"
v.1. --- "they ought not to leak out".

長生久視之道
This is the way to long life and to the permanent view.

> 深根固蔕者乃長生久視之道
Deep-going root and firm trunk are thus the way to long life and to the permanent view.
