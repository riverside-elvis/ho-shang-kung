# Ch. 31 偃武 How to suppress war.

夫佳兵不祥之器
Now beautiful weapons are tools of evil.

> 佳 (beautiful) = ornamented.
祥善也
祥 = good.
兵者驚精神濁和氣
Weapons excite the spirit and dim the harmonious atmosphere.
不善人之器也
They are evil tools.
不當修飾之
One ought not to use them [even] if they are ornamented.

>> The explanation 佳飾也 is missing in most editions,
which might point to the character 佳
as also having been absent from the original text of Lao-tse.
For several other reasons which may be adduced for this assumption,
see Erkes in Artibus Asiae V, 306/7.

物或惡之
Each of the creatures hates them.

> 兵動
則有所害
If weapons are set in motion,
somebody is hurt.
故萬物無有不惡之
Therefore there is no creature that would not hate them.
{惡烏路反}

故有道者不處
Therefore he who has Tao does not remain with them.

> 有道之人不處其國
A man possessing Tao does not stay in such a country.

君子居則貴左
The superior man stays at home and honours the left side.

> 貴柔弱也
He honours what is tender and weak.

用兵則貴右
Who makes use of weapons honours the right side.

> 貴剛強也
He honours what is hard and strong.
此言兵道與君子道反
This means that the way of the warrior and the way of the superior man are opposed to each other.
所貴者異也
What they honour is different.

>> As Ho-shang-kung thinks of the superior man
and of the man who uses weapons as of two different persons,
the translation of the text must conform to his conception.

兵者不祥之器
Weapons are the tools of evil.

> 兵革者不善之器也
Weapons and cuirasses are no good tools.

非君子之器
They are not tools of the superior man.

> 非君子所貴重器也
They are not tools that are esteemed and thought to be important by a superior man.

不得巳
而用之
If he cannot act otherwise,
then he uses them.

> 謂
This means:
遭衰逆亂禍
欲加萬民
乃用之以自守
If he suffers from weakness and confusion,
if the misery is going to spread to the people,
then he uses them.

恬惔為上
To be peaceful and quiet makes a prince.

> 不貪土地利人財寳
He craves not for the land of the nobles nor for the people's riches.

>> The curious expression 士地 which would mean "the land of the nobles"
or "of the officials" is perhaps only a misprint
for the current 土地 "territories".
By some mistake, the Tao-tsang edition does not contain
this part of the commentary but prints the next explanation twice.
{惔一本作然}

勝
而不美
If he is victorious,
he does not think it beautiful.

> 雖得勝
而不以為利己也
Though he wins a victory,
he does not think it a blessing.

而美之者是樂殺人
But who thinks this beautiful enjoys the killing of men.

> 美得勝者是為喜樂殺人者也
To think it beautiful to win a victory means to enjoy the killing of men.

夫樂殺人者則不可以得志於天下矣
Now who enjoys the killing of men may not realise his intentions on the empire.

> 為人君
而樂殺人此不可使得志於天下
Who, being a prince,
enjoys the killing of men is unable to practise his intentions on the empire.
為人主
必專制人命
妄行刑誅
Who, being a prince,
is bent on forcing the destiny of men,
wrongly deals out punishments.

>> Instead of 誅 "punishments" v.1. 罰 same meaning.

吉事尚左
Therefore for happy occasions one chooses the left.

> 左生位也
The left side is the throne of life.

凶事尚右
For unhappy occasions one chooses the right.

> 隂道殺人
The Yin-Tao is deadly.

>> Various readings are "the Yin-Tao kills men" and "the right is the Yin-Tao".

偏將軍居左
The general sits to the left.

> 偏將軍卑而居陽者
以其不專殺也
The general is a subordinate but remains in the Yang,
as killing is not his main business.

上將軍居右
The marshal sits to the right.

> 上將軍尊而居右者
言其主殺也
The marshal is more prominent but he sits to the right,
as killing is his main business.

言
This means:
以䘮禮處之
according to the rites of mourning he sits there.

> 上將軍於右
The marshal sits to the right.
䘮禮尚右
死人貴隂也
For the rites of mourning the right side is chosen,
as the dead honour the Yin.

殺人之衆以悲哀泣之
The killed multitudes are wept for according to the rites of mourning.

> 傷已
德薄
If one hurts the self,
Tao diminishes.
不能以道化人
而害无辜之民
If one is not able to change men by Tao,
one hurts the harmless people.

戰勝以䘮禮處之
The victor in battle ought to sit there according to the rites of mourning.

> 古者
戰勝將軍居䘮主禮之位
素服而哭之
In ancient times,
the general who had won a battle sat according to the rites of mourning on the seat of honour,
wearing white robes and weeping.
明君子貴德而賤兵
This meant that a superior man honours Te and despises the weapons.
不得巳誅不祥
心不樂之比於䘮也
If he is unable to eradicate misery,
his heart is sorry as if he were in mourning.
知後丗用兵不巳
He knows that posterity will use the weapons without accomplishing anything. 
故悲痛之
Therefore he suffers.
