# Ch. 35 仁德 On the Te of humanity.

執大象
天下往
To him who holds fast to the great idea,
the empire comes.

> 執守也
執 = to keep.
象道也
象 the idea is Tao.
聖人守大道
則天下萬民移心歸往之也
If the saint keeps Great Tao,
then all the people in the empire change their mind and return to him.
治身
則天降神明往來於巳也
If he practises asceticism,
then heaven causes the spirits to descend and to have intercourse within his self.

>> Instead of "all the people" v.1. "all the beings".

往而不害
It comes without being endangered.
安平太
Peace and quietude are great.

> 萬物歸往而不傷害
則國安家寧
而致太平矣
If all beings return without being endangered,
then the empire is pacified and the families are peaceful,
and the great peace is reached.
治身不害神明
則身安而大壽也
If one practises asceticism without endangering the spirits,
then the body is restful and extremely longlived.

樂與餌
過客止
Where there is joy and beauty,
the passing guest remains.

> 餌美也
餌 (lit. cake) = 美 beauty.
過客一也
The passing guest is unity.
人能樂美於道
則一留止也
If a man is able to enjoy Tao,
then unity remains.
一者去盈而處虚
Unity leaves fulness and stays within emptiness.
忽忽如過客
It appears suddenly like a passing guest.
{樂音岳餌
而志反}

道之出口
淡乎其無味
But if Tao comes out of the mouth,
how insipid, O! is its tastelessness!

> 道出入於口
淡淡非如五味有酸鹹苦甘辛也
When Tao leaves and enters the mouth,
it is insipid and does not resemble the five tastes.
{出尺□[^35-1]反
淡徒暫反}

>> Some editions of the Tao-te-ching read 言 "words" instead of 口 "mouth",
but this reading is refuted by the wording of the commentary.

視之不足見
If one looks for it, it is not sufficient to be seen.

> 足德也
足 (to be sufficient) = 得 to be able to.
道無形非若五色
{有青黄赤白黒}
可得見也
Tao is formless and does not resemble the five colours that can be seen.

聽之
不足聞
If one listens for it,
it is not sufficient to be heard.

> 道非若五音
{有宫商角徵羽}
可得聽聞也
Tao does not resemble the five sounds that can be heard.

用之
不可旣
If one uses it,
it cannot become exhausted.

> 用道治國
則國安民昌
If one uses Tao in governing a country,
then the country is peaceful and the people are radiant.
治身
則壽命延長無有旣盡時也
If one practises asceticism,
then life is prolonged and there is no exhaustion of time.
