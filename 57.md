# Ch. 57 淳風 How to simplify customs.

以正治國
By attaining justice one governs a country.

> 以至也
以 = 至 to attain.
天使正身之人使至有國也
Heaven which wants to rectify the personality of a man allows him to come into possession of a country.

>> The Tao-tsang edition reads 治 "governs",
like Wang Pi's text, whereas Li Ch'iao's text has 理 "regulates".

以竒用兵
By attaining deceit one uses weapons.

> 竒詐也
奇 = 詐 to deceive.
天
使詐為之人
使用兵也
Heaven,
if wanting to deceive a man,
allows him to use weapons.

>> As this sentence and the next one are parallels to the foregoing one,
Ho-shang-kung evidently wants 以 to be taken
in the same sense he gives to it there,
though he does not expressly say so.

以無事取天下
By attaining inactivity one takes the empire.

> 以無事無為之人使取天下為之主
By inactivity and non-action a man may take the empire and make himself its master.

吾何以知其然哉
How do I know that this is so?
以此
By this.

> 此今也
This is the presence.
老子言
Lao-tse says:
我何以知天意然哉
How do I know the intentions of heaven to be such?
以今日所見知
By what I see today I know them.

>> Compare the last notes on ch. 21.

天下多忌諱
而民彌貧
The more prohibitions there are in the empire,
the poorer the people are.

> 天下謂人主也
By the empire the prince is meant.
忌諱者防禁也
忌諄 chi-hui are prohibitions.
令煩
則姦生
If the law becomes oppressive,
malignity arises.
禁多
則下詐
If there are many prohibitions,
the subjects become deceitful.
相殆
They all deceive each other.
故貧
Therefore they will become poor.

>> The Tao-tsang edition commences ch. 57 with this sentence.

民多利器
國家滋昬
The more sharp tools the people have,
the more are state and family thrown into disorder.

> 利器者權也
The sharp tools are power.
民多權
則視者眩於目
聽者惑於耳
When the people have much power,
then the eyes of those who see are blinded,
the ears of those who hear are confused.
上下不親
Prince and subjects are not attached to each other.
故國家昏亂
Therefore state and family are confused.

人多伎巧
竒物滋起
The more adroitness and intelligence man has,
the more curious things appear.

> 人謂人君
Man is the prince.
{百里諸侯也}
多知伎巧
謂刻畫
宫觀
彫琢
服章
竒物
Polymathy and adroitness,
plastics and pictures,
palaces,
carvings
and multicoloured garments
are curious things.
滋起
下則化上
The more they appear,
the more the subjects turn against the prince.
飾金鏤玉
文繡
綵色
日以滋甚
Ornamental gold and carved gems,
ornamented silks,
variegated colours
daily more appear.

>> The characters "palaces, carvings and multicoloured garments"
are missing in one edition, as well as the words "variegated colours".

法物滋彰
盗賊多有
The more laws are published,
the more robbers are there.

> 法物好物也
The law is something good.
珎好之物滋生彰著
則農事廢
飢寒並至
The more beautiful and good things become known,
the more the affairs of agriculture are neglected,
and hunger and cold penetrate everywhere.
故盗賊多有也
Therefore there are many robbers and thieves.

>> Instead of 法好也 "the law is something good"
v.1. 法物好物也 "the law is a good thing".

故聖人云
Therefore a saint says:

> 謂下事也

我無為[^57-1]
而民自化
I do nothing,
and the people change of themselves.

> Therefore a saint speaks as follows:
I do not act,
and the people change of themselves.
聖人言
A saint says:
我修道承天
I cultivate Tao and receive [the commands of] heaven.
无所攺作
而民自化成也
I do not need to change anything,
and the people become perfect of themselves.

我無事
而民自富
I am without activity,
and the people become rich of themselves.

> 我無徭役徴召之事
I do not call the people to service but let them stay with their business.
{民安其業}
故皆自富
Therefore everybody becomes rich of himself.

我好靜
而民自正
I love quietude,
and the people are law-abiding of themselves.

> 聖人言
The saint says:
我好靜
不言不教
民皆自忠正也
If I love quietude,
if I neither speak nor act,
then all the people will be loyal and law-abiding of themselves.

我無欲
而民自朴
I am without desires,
and the people are simple of themselves.

> 我常無欲
去華文
民則隨我為多質朴也
If I am always without desires,
if I do away with externals,
then the people will follow me and remain simple and natural.

>> One edition adds after
"if I do away with externals":
{徴服飾}
"if I hold garments and ornaments to be of little value".

I am without feelings, and the people are pure.

> 聖人言
The saint says:
我修道守真絕去六情
民自隨我而清也
If I practise Tao and sincerity and do away with the six feelings,
the people will follow me and be pure.

>> This part of the commentary, together with the sentence it explains,
is only contained in the Tao-tsang edition.
