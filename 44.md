# Ch. 44 立戒 How to set up commandments.

名與身
孰親

Name or body,
which is nearer?

> 名遂
則身退也
If the name follows,
then the body retreats.

身與貨
孰多
Body or wealth,
which is more?

> 財多
則害身也
If riches are manifold,
then they will harm the body.

得與亡
孰病
To win or to lose,
what hurts more?

> 好得利
則病於行也
If you strive to win riches,
this is hurtful to your doings.

甚愛必大費
Intense love is surely great waste.

> 甚愛色
費精神
If one loves a beauty with intensity,
one wastes spirituality.
甚愛財
遇禍患
If one loves wealth with intensity,
one gets into misfortune.
所愛者
少
What one loves,
is inferior.
所亡者
多
What one loses,
is important.
故言大費
Therefore this is called great waste.

>> Instead of 禍患 "misfortune" v.1. 患害, same meaning.
Instead of 愛者 "what one loves" v.1. 愛甚 "what one loves with intensity".

多藏必厚亡
To hide much is surely a heavy loss.

> 生多藏於府庫
死多藏於丘墓
生有攻刼之憂
死有掘冢探柩之患
When alive, to hide much in the treasury,
when dead, to hide much in the grave-mound,
this during life brings about the sorrow of being robbed,
in death the sorrow of having the mound dug out and the coffin searched.

知足不辱
Who knows contentedness will not be disgraced.

> 知足之人
絶利
去欲
不辱於身
A man who knows contentedness
keeps away from advantage,
avoids desires
and thereby experiences no humiliation done to his person.

知止不殆
Who knows when to stop is not endangered.

> 知可止則
財利不累身
聲色不亂於耳目
則身不危殆也
Who knows himself to be able to stop, that one will stop.
If wealth and profit do not enmesh the body,
if sound and colour do not confuse the ears and eyes,
then the body is not endangered.

可以長久
Thereby he is able to last long.

> 人能知止足
則福禄在己
If one is able to know when to stop and how to be content,
then luck and gain stay within oneself.
治身者
神不勞
If one practises asceticism,
the spirits are not troubled.
治國者
民不擾
If one governs a country,
the people are not bothered.
故可長久
Therefore one is able to last long.
