# Appendix: Introduction

The following is the introduction from
_Ho-Shang-Kung: Ho-Shang-Kung's commentary on Lao-Tse._
Translated and annotated by Eduard Erkes, 1958.

---
The first mention of a commentary bearing the name of Ho-shang-kung
is found in the catalogue of Taoist literature
given in the Sui-shu[^introduction-1].
There an edition of Lao-tse in two parts is enumerated
which is said to have been furnished with a commentary by Ho-shang-kung
in the time of the emperor Han Wen-ti (B.C. 179-157).
Next to nothing is known about this author, not even his name;
Ho-shang-kung 河上公 "the old man of the banks of the Huang-ho"
being only a pseudonym of the kind Taoist hermits
have always liked to assume[^introduction-2].
Ko Hsüan 葛玄, a Taoist of the 3rd century A.D.,
has written a preface to Ho-shang-kung's edition of Lao-tse
in which he gives the few items which at his time
one thought to know about Ho-shang-kung[^introduction-3].
According to Ko Hsüan, the family name
and personal designation of Ho-shang-kung are unknown.
He lived in a self-constructed reed-hut on the banks of the Huang-ho
and devoted himself exclusively to the study of the Tao-te-ching.
To Han Wen-ti who had looked in vain
for a competent interpreter of the Tao-te-ching
he was recommended as a leading authority on the book
and thereupon invited to court.
But he declined the invitation, saying:
"Tao is esteemed and Te honoured, one cannot ask much about them."
Thereupon the emperor himself went to see the excentric hermit
and addressed him as follows:

> | “Under wide heaven everywhere
> | No land that's not the king's you see.
> | Within the borders of the land
> | No one but serves his majesty.[^introduction-4]

Within the world there are the four great ones,
and the king dwells in their unity[^introduction-5].
Though you possess the Tao, you belong to our people.
As you are not able to humiliate yourself,
how could you be exalted?[^introduction-6]
We are able to make people rich and honoured or poor and despised.”
Thereupon Ho-shang-kung suddenly rose high into the air and spoke from above:
"Now above I have not reached heaven,
in the middle I am not bound to men,
below I am not staying on earth.
How do I belong to the people?
How could your Majesty want to make me rich and honoured
or poor and despised?"
Now the emperor knew that he had a real saint before him,
repented of his brusqueness and excused himself,
whereupon Ho-shang-kung with some further admonitions
presented him with his commentary.
The emperor studied it carefully and became an ardent Taoist.

Apart from the fantastic character of the whole story,
Chinese critics have long since pointed out that it is almost unthinkable
that a commentary personally dedicated to the emperor
should not be mentioned in the book-catalogue of the Han-shu
and nothing of any kind said about Ho-shang-kung and his work
in the entire literature of the Han time[^introduction-7].
Besides this, the language of the commentary
tells decidedly against its being a work of the second century B.C.,
as the enormous amount of synonymic compounds which it contains
does not point to the time of the Earlier Han but to a later date of the book.

Nevertheless the commentary cannot have been written so very much later.
Towards the close of the Later Han dynasty it must have been in existence.
Pelliot has refuted the statement of Maspero that Ho-shang-kung
was quoted by Mou-tse 牟子,
a Buddhist author of the third century A.D.[^introduction-8],
but there is another proof that the commentary already existed
in the second century A.D.
In Lao-tse ch. 56
the expression hsüan-t'ung 玄同 "the mysterious union" occurs,
and in Huai-nan-tse 16, 7b this term is defined as follows:
"If one strives for beauty, beauty is not attained.
If one does not strive for beauty, one becomes beautiful.
If one strives for ugliness, ugliness is not attained.
If one does not strive for ugliness, one becomes ugly.
If one strives neither for beauty nor for ugliness,
one will be neither beautiful nor ugly.
This is called the mysterious union."
The last sentence is quoted from Lao-tse ch. 56.
Huai-nan-tse's commentator Kao Yu remarks on this:
"Hsüan is heaven. Heaven has nothing for which it might strive.
If man is able to have nothing for which be strives,
then be will become united with it."
This interpretation doubtless goes back to Ho-shang-kung
who maintains the curious and linguistically impossible view
that hsüan in the Tao-te-ching always means heaven---a meaning which
hsüan in fact only has in the combination
hsüan-huang 玄黃 "the blue one and the yellow one" = heaven and earth---and
who gives this explanation which leads to the most curious consequences
nearly always when hsüan occurs in the text[^introduction-9].
In ch. 56 he remarks on the sentence
"This is called the mysterious union":
"The dark one is heaven.
If man is able to execute these great doings,
this means that he together with heaven becomes united with Tao."
So Kao Yu who wrote in the second century A.D, must have known Ho-shang-kung,
and therefore Ho-shang-kung's commentary existed
under the Later Han dynasty[^introduction-10].
That Ho-shang-kung himself is not dependent on Kao Yu
follows from Kao Yu's only casually mentioning this conception of hsüan,
whereas Ho-shang-kung makes a complete system of it[^introduction-11].

Mou-tse too contains a proof that Ho-shang-kung existed
before the third century A.D.
He mentions the fact that the first part of the Tao-te-ching
contains 37 chapters[^introduction-12].
Now the present arrangement of the Tao-te-ching and its division
into a Tao-ching of 37 and a Te-ching of 44 chapters,
as well as the headings of the chapters
which are missing in Wang Pi's edition,
goes back to Ho-shang-kung, whose textual disposition
must therefore have existed about A.D. 200[^introduction-13].
A third proof for the existence of Ho-shang-kung's commentary at this time
is the preface written by Ko Hsüan in the third century.
So Ho-shang-kung's commentary is doubtless the oldest
coherent interpretation of Lao-tse which has come down to us,
and as such it deserves special attention.

The division of the Tao-ching into 37 chapters
has led Pelliot to the thought that it might perhaps
be an imitation of the 37 Buddhist Bodhipakṣika,
together with which it is mentioned by Mou-tse[^introduction-14].
But later he has rejected this idea and rather thinks that
the coincidence of both caused Mou-tse to compare them[^introduction-15].
Certainly Buddhist influence is conceivable
in an author of the second century A.D.,
but in Ho-shang-kung I have only been able to discover one trace of it,
though this indication seems to me rather unmistakable.
It consists in the mention of the she-fang 十方,
the ten directions of the world, in ch. 10.
For this conception is unknown to the cosmology of ancient China
and is even today regarded as typically Buddhistic[^introduction-16].

After having read a few of the explanations which Ho-shang-kung gives,
the reader will see that the purpose of his commentary
was not only the furnishing
of a philological and philosophical interpretation of the Tao-te-ching
but that his chief aim consists in enabling the reader
to make practical use of the book and in teaching him
to use it as a guide to meditation
and to a life becoming a Taoist skilled in meditative training.
The headings of the chapters which Ho-shang-kung gives
ought therefore to be taken as denoting instructions
given to the reader and are translated accordingly.

Of the many editions of Ho-shang-kung,
I had the newest and most complete one at my disposal,
the text edited by Li Ch'iao in his invaluable critical collection
of the fragments of lost commentaries on Lao-tse[^introduction-17].
Besides this I could make use of the edition
contained in the Tao-tsang which contains some variants
not given by Li Ch'iao[^introduction-18].
As editions of Ho-shang-kung are generally accessible,
it was not necessary to print the text,
the more as this in view of its large extent
would have been practically impossible.
