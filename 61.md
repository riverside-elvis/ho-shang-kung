# Ch. 61 謙德 On the Te of humility.

大國者下流
A great country is the undercurrent,

> 治大國當如
Who governs a large country
must be like the [Yang-tse-]chiang and the sea.
居下流不逆細微
He must belong to the undercurrent
and not be opposed to what is small and insignificant.

>> The words "the [Yang-tse-]chiang and the sea" are missing in one edition.
Then the meaning would be "must behave as if he belonged to the undercurrent".
Instead of 逆 "to be opposed" v.1. | 於 with the same meaning.

天下之交
the union of the empire,

> 大國天下士民之所交會
A great country is one where scholars and people of the empire assemble.

天下之牝
the female of the empire.
牝常以靜勝牡
The female always by quietness conquers the male.

> 牝者隂□[^61-1]也
The female is of the Yin class.
柔謙和而不昌也
Weak and humble she adapts herself and does not take the initiative.
{牝頻忍反}

{牝常以靜勝牡}

> 女所以勝屈於男隂勝陽
以安盡不先求之也
Whereby woman is able to bend man and Yin is able to vanquish Yang,
is by their quietly keeping still and not taking the lead.

以靜為下
By quietness she submits.

> 隂道以安靜為謙下
The way of the Yin is to keep quietly still and to submit humbly.

故大國以下小國
則取小國
Therefore a great country by submitting to a small country
thus wins the small country.

> 能謙下之
則常有之
If one is able humbly to submit,
one always wins.
{下遐嫁反
取七喻反
又七愉反}

>> Instead of 取 "wins" v.1. 有 "possesses".

小國以下大國
則取大國
If a small country submits to a great country,
it wins the great country.

> 此言
This means:
國无大小
能執謙畜人
Though a country may be neither great nor small,
it is able to keep to humility and to nourish its people.
則无過失也
Then it experiences neither mistakes nor losses.

故或下以取
或下而取
Therefore one submits and wins,
one submits and is won.

> 下者謂
大國以下小國
小國以下大國
更以義相取
The submitting means
that a great country by submitting to a small country,
and a small country by submitting to a great country,
through justice win each other.

大國不過欲兼畜人
Now a great country ought not to exceed the wish to make people humble and to nourish them.
小國不過欲入事人
A small country ought not to exceed the wish to let people come in and to employ them.

> 大國不可失
則兼并人國
而牧畜之
A great country, in order not to lose its subjects,
thus assembles the [people from] the small countries
and turns them into shepherds and labourers.
{過古和反
又古卧反}
使為臣僕
It induces them to become menials.

夫兩者
各得其所欲
Now of both,
each obtains what it wishes for.
大者宜為下
The great one must submit.

> 大國小國
各欲得其所
A great country and a small country,
each gets what it wishes for.
大國又宜為謙下
And the great one ought to submit.
