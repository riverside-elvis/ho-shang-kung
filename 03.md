# Ch. 3 安民 How to pacify the people.

不尚賢
Not to exalt the worthies

> 賢謂丗俗之賢
By the worthies the average worthies of the world are meant.
辯口
明文
離道
行權
去質
為文也
They exchange opinions,
make themselves intelligible,
detach themselves from Tao,
adapt themselves to circumstances,
avoid reality
and effect appearance.
不尚者
不貴之以禄
不貴之以官
Those who are not commendable
may not be honoured with functions
nor endowed with posts.

>> Instead of "those who are not commendable" v.1. "the worthies of the world".

使民不爭
does not cause the people to contend.

> 不爭功名返自然也
Do not contend for merit and glory but return to nature.

不貴難得之貨
Not to praise treasures difficult to gain

> 言人君不御好珎寳
This means that a prince ought not to rule with a love for precious treasures.
黄金棄於山
珠玉捐於淵
He should cast the money [back] to the mountains [where it came from]
and throw the pearls and jewels into the lakes.

使民不為盗
causes people not to become thieves.

> 上化清淨
下无貪人
If the superiors turn towards purity,
the inferiors are not greedy.

>> For 淨 "purity" v.1. 靜 "stillness".

不見可欲
Not to show things desirable

> 放鄭聲逺美人
One ought to banish the songs of Cheng and to keep away adulators.

>> The commentary is a quotation from Lun-yü 15, 10.
For 侫人 "adulators" v.1. 美人 "beauties",
which differs from the reading of the Lun-yü and is therefore to be rejected.

使心不亂
does not lead the mind into confusion.

> 不邪淫不惑亂也
Do not be bad and excessive nor unstable and confused.

是以聖人治
Therefore the government of the saint

> 說聖人治國與治身同也
This means to govern the country together with the body.

>> 治身 "to govern the body" means in Taoist terminology
the same as "to lead the life of an ascetic".
We will therefore regularly translate it by "to practise asceticism".

虛其心
empties their minds and fills their bellies,

> 除嗜欲去亂煩
Abandon desire and flee from confusion and trouble.
實其腹懐道
抱一
守五神也
Enclose Tao in your bosom,
embrace unity
and retain the five spirits.

>> Instead of 抱一 "embrace unity" an expression alluding to ch. 10,
there is a variant 抱道 "embrace Tao",
which is rejected by Li Ch'iao.
On the five spirits of the bowels, see ch. 6.

弱其志
weakens their will

> 和柔謙讓不處權也
Side with the weak and supple and do not stay with the powerful.

強其骨
and strengthens their bones.

> 愛精重施
Save the semen and make its extension difficult.
髓滿骨堅
Then the marrow will become filled and the bones firm.
{強其良反}

>> Instead of 施 "extension" v.1. 氣 "breath".

常使民無知無欲
He always induces the people not to know and not to desire.

> 反朴守淳
Return to simplicity and retain purity.

使夫知者不敢為也
He causes the knowing ones not to dare to act.

> 思慮深不輕言
Think with awe of the depth and do not take words easy.
{夫音符
知音智}

為無為
If one acts non-action,

> 不造作動因循
To do nothing sets inertness in motion.

則無不治
then nothing is not governed.

> 德化厚
百姓安
If Te is changed to fulness,
then the People are pacified.

>> Instead of □[^03-1] "fulness" v.1. 厚, same meaning.
