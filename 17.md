# Ch. 17 淳風 On primitive customs.

太上下知有之
In the highest antiquity the subjects knew that they existed.

> 太上謂太古无名之君也
By highest antiquity the nameless princes of highest antiquity are meant.
下知有之者
The subjects knew that they existed [means]:
下知上有君
而不臣事
the subjects knew that there was a prince above them,
but they showed no trace of servile behaviour.
質朴也
This was the fulness of simplicity and naturalness.

>> The Tao-tsang edition reads instead of the last sentence:
"but they showed no servile behaviour but simplicity and naturalness.
Li Ch'iao rejects this reading.

其次親之譽之
In the next [period] they were attached to them and praised them.

> 其德可見
恩惠可稱
Their Te was visible,
their benevolence was admired.
故親愛而譽之
Therefore they were loved and praised.

其次畏之
In the next one they feared them.

> 設刑法
They devised laws and punishments.
以治之

其次侮之

{侮亡甫反}

信不足焉
If faith is not sufficient,

> 君信不足於下
下則應之以不信
If the prince's faith towards his subjects is not sufficient,
then the subjects become a nation of swindlers.

>> The Tao-tsang edition reads:
{而欺其君也}
"then the subjects deceive their prince".

Then there is no faith.

> If the prince's faith towards his subjects is not sufficient,
then the subjects correspond to this
and cheat their prince through faithlessness.

whenever they had to undertake something,
were cautious and rated it high to put stress on their words.
