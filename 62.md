# Ch. 62 為道 How to exert Tao.

道者萬物之奥
Tao is the hiding-place of all beings.

> 奥藏也
奧 ngao is a hiding-place.
道為萬物之藏
Tao is the hiding-place of all beings.
無所不容也
There is nothing which it did not contain.
{奥於六反
又烏報反}

善人之寳
The treasure of the good man.

> 善人以道為身寳
The good man makes Tao the treasure of his person.
不敢違
He does not dare to depart from it.

不善人之所保
That which the bad man guards.

> 道者不善人之保倚也
Tao is what the bad man guards.
遭患
逢急
猶自知悔卑下
If he meets with sorrow,
if he is pressed by hurry,
he seems to know repentance for his vileness.

美言可以市
In fine words one may trade.

> 美言者獨可於市耳
In fine words one is only able to wade.
夫市交易而退
For bartering is easy and retraction incongruous.
不相宜善言美語
求者欲疾得
賣者欲疾售也
As to fine and insinuating words,
the buyer wants to acquire them quickly,
and the seller wants to get quickly rid of them.

尊行可以加人
By dignified behaviour one is able to differ from others.

> 加别也
加 = 別 to differ.
人有尊貴之行
可以别異於凡人未足以尊道
If a man knows how to behave in exalted and low conditions,
he will be able to be different from all other men but not yet sufficient to venerate Tao.
{行下孟反}

人之不善
何棄之有
Though a man be bad,
how could he be rejected?

> 人雖不善
當以道化之
Though a man be bad,
he must be improved by Tao.
盖三皇之前無有棄民
Surely in the times of the three Exalted Ones there was no rejection of the people.
德化淳也
Te vastly improved them.

>> Instead of 以道化 "to improve by Tao" v.1. | | 伏 "to repress by Tao",
which goes against the sense.
Instead of 三時之皇 "in the times of the three Exalted Ones"
v.1. | | | 前 "before the three Exalted Ones".
Instead of □ "vastly" v.1. 厚, with the same meaning.

故立天子置三公
Therefore they installed the son of heaven and appointed the three dukes.

> 欲使教化不善之人
One wanted to improve the bad men.

雖有拱璧以先駟馬
不如坐進此道
Though one has a jade-sceptre and takes precedence in a quadriga,
this is not equal to sitting there and approaching Tao.

> 雖有美璧先駟馬而至
故不如坐進此道
Though one may have a beautiful sceptre of jade and take precedence in a quadriga,
it is better to sit still and to approach Tao.
{拱居勇反
先悉薦反}

古之所以貴此道者
Why the ancients esteemed this Tao, why was this the case?
何不日以求得
Not because they daily strove to acquire it?

> 古之所以貴此道者不日日逺行求索
That by which the ancients esteemed this Tao was not daily roaming far in order to look for it.
近得之於身
They found it near themselves in their persons.

有罪以免耶
By having sin one avoids evil.

> 有罪謂遭亂世
To have sin means to find the world in confusion.
闇君妄行刑誅
A benighted prince falsifies the course by indulging in punishments.
修道則可以解死免於衆耶也
By cultivating Tao one may avoid all evil.

>> Instead of 解免 "to avoid" v.1. 死 | "avoid in death",
probably a wrong reading.
Instead of 衆邪 "all evil" v.1. 罪 | "sin and evil".

故為天下貴
Therefore one is honoured within the empire.

> 道德洞逺
无不覆済
If Tao and Te penetrate thoroughly,
everything is embraced and redeemed.
全身
治國
恬然无為
When completing the personality,
when governing the country,
one ought to be quiet and without action.
故可為天下貴也
Then one may be honoured within the empire.
