# Ch. 47 鑒遠 How to mirror the distant.

不出户知天下
Without passing through the door one knows the empire.

> 聖人不出户以知天下者
A saint knows the empire without passing through his door.
以己身知人身
By means of his own personality he knows the personalities of other men.
以巳家知人家
By means of his own family he knows the families of other men.
所以見天下也
Thereby he surveys the empire.

不窺牖見天道
Without looking through the window one sees the way of heaven.

> 天道與人道同
The way of heaven is identical with the way of man.
大人相通
Heaven and man permeate each other;
精氣相貫
their essences penetrate each other.
人君清淨
天氣自正
If the prince is pure and quiet,
then the atmosphere of heaven is spontaneously right.
人君多欲
天氣煩濁
If the prince has many desires,
then the heavenly atmosphere is dim.
吉凶
利害
皆由於巳
Luck and misfortune,
advantage and disadvantage,
everything arises from the self.
{窺起規反
牖音酉}

>> The first eight characters are missing in one edition,
so that the text commences:
By permeating each other the essences penetrate each other.

其出彌逺
其知彌少
The farther the going,
the less the knowledge.

> 謂
This means:
去其家觀人家
去其身觀人身
If one leaves his family in order to look at the families of other men,
if one leaves his personality in order to look at the personalities of other men:
所觀益逺
所用益少也
the farther away that is what one inspects,
the less will be what one gets to know.

>> Instead of "what one gets to know" v.1. "what one uses", without sense.
A variant of the last sentence reads:
Though that at which one looks is very far away,
that which one sees is very small.

是以聖人不行而知
Therefore the saint does not go about and still knows.

> 聖人
不上天
不入淵
能知天地
The saint,
without rising to heaven,
without diving into the abyss,
is able to know heaven and earth.
以心知之
He knows them by means of his mind.

不見而名
Without seeing he names.

> 上好道
下好德
If the prince loves Tao,
the subjects love Te.
上好武
下好力
If the prince loves war,
the subjects love force.
聖人原小知大
The saint proceeds from the small in order to know the great.
察內知外
He looks at the interior to know the exterior.

無為而成
He does nothing and nevertheless completes.

> 上无所為
則下無事
If the prince does nothing,
the subjects are without activity.
家給人足
萬物自化成也
If the family has enough and the individual sufficient,
everything improves of itself.

>> Instead of 化就 "improves" v.1. | 成 "becomes perfected".
