# Ch. 65 淳德 On the Te of simplicity.

古之善為道者
Those who of old well practised Tao,

> 治古之善以道治身及治國者
By this those are meant who of old with Tao well practised asceticism and governed the country.

>> Instead of 謂 "are meant" v.1. 說 "are called".

非以明民
Thereby did not enlighten the people.

> 不以道敎民
They did not enlighten the people with Tao.
明知巧詐也
Enlightenment is cunning hypocrisy.

>> Instead of 明知 "enlightenment" v.1. | 智, the same.
Instead of 功詐 "cunning hypocrisy" v.1. 奸巧 "deceitful cunning".

將以愚之
They wanted to keep them stupid.

> 將以道德教民使朴質不詐偽
By Tao and Te they wanted to teach the people how to keep simple and plain and not to become hypocrites.

>> V.1. "plain and simple".

民之難治以其智多
That the people are difficult to govern is because of the abundance of their knowledge.

> 以其智多
故為巧偽
As their wisdom is too much,
they thus become cunning and hypocritical.

>> Instead of 而 "thus" v.1. 作 "this causes them to become ...".

以智治國國之賊
Therefore to govern a country by wisdom is to rob the country.

> 使智惠之人治國之政事
必逺道德
妄作威福
When the affairs of the government of a country are left to wise and intelligent men,
it will surely secede from Tao and Te,
and perversity will be its highest bliss.
為國之賊
This is to rob the country.

>> Instead of 慧 "intelligent" v.1. 惠 "benign".
Instead of 遠 "it will secede" v.1. 背 "it will turn its back to".
Instead of 爲 "this is" v.1. 乃是 "and this is".

不以智治國國之福
To govern a country without wisdom is the country's bliss.

> 不使智惠之人知國之政事
則民守正直不為邪飾
When the affairs of a country are left to men neither wise nor intelligent,
then the people keep to the right and do not work unto badness and outwardness.
上下相親
君臣同力
Ruler and subjects are near to each other,
prince and minister work together.
故為國之福也
Thereby they bring the country's bliss about.

>> Instead of 慧 "intelligent" v.1. 惠 "benign".
The first sentence is missing in the Che-yao.

知此兩者亦楷式
Who knows these two will also be a model and pattern.

> 兩者謂智與不智者
These two mean wisdom and ignorance.
常能智者為賊不智者能為福
The wise man necessarily brings about theft and the ignorant man bliss.
是治身治國之法式也
He himself is a model for the practice of asceticism and the government of the country.

>> Behind 當 "necessarily" one edition adds 常能 "is always able to".
Instead of 智者 "the wise man" v.1. 智 "wisdom",
instead of 不知者 "the ignorant man" v.1. 不知 "ignorance".
Instead 爲福 "brings about bliss" v.1. 能 | | "is able to bring about bliss".

常知楷式
是謂玄德
To know always the model and pattern,
this is called the Te of the dark one.

> 玄天也
The dark one is heaven.
能知治身及治國之法式
是謂與天同德也
To be able to know the pattern for the government of the country and the practice of asceticism,
this means a Te which is identical with [that of] heaven.

>> On this interpretation of hsüan "dark" see note on ch. 1.

玄德深矣逺矣
The Te of the dark one is deep and far away.

> 玄德之人
深不可則
逺不可極也
The man who possesses the Te of the dark one
is so deep that he cannot be fathomed,
and so far away that be cannot be reached.

與物反矣
The contrary of things.

> 玄德之人與萬物反異
The man who possesses the Te of the dark one is the contrary of all beings.
萬物欲益已
玄徳施與人也
All beings wish to complete themselves,
[but he who possesses] the Te of the dark one wishes to promote others.

乃至於大順
And then he reaches the great obedience.

> {玄德與萬物反異
故能至大順
順天理也}

>> Li Ch'iao notes that the last sentence is quoted in the commentary of
Hsi Shu-ye's 嵇叔衣 (Hsi K'ang's 嵇康)
Yang-sheng-lun 養生論 (Wen-hsüan 53,4b)
as follows: 河上公曰大順者天理也
"Ho-shang-kung says: The great obedience is the principle of heaven".
