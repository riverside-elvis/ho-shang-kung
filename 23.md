# Ch. 23 虛無 How to empty nothingness.

希言自然
To speak little is natural.

> 希言者是愛言也
To speak little means to save words.
愛言者自然之道
To save words is the natural way.

飄風不終朝
A whirlwind does not outlast a morning.
驟雨不終日
A shower does not outlast a day.

> 飄風疾風也
A whirlwind is a sudden wind.
驟雨暴雨也
A shower is a violent rain.
言
疾不能長
暴不能久也
This means that
suddenness is not able to last 
and violence not able to endure.
{驟狀救反}

孰為此者
Who effects this?
天地
Heaven and earth.

> {孰誰也
誰為此飄風暴雨者乎
天地所為}

{天地尚不能久}

> 不終於朝暮也

{而况於人乎}

> 天地至神合為飄風暴雨
尚不能使終朝至暮
Heaven and earth in their highest spiritual union produce whirlwinds and showers,
but they are not yet able to let them outlast a morning.
何况人欲為暴卒乎
How much less ought one to have desires, when violence is so transient!

故從事於道者
Thus who in his actions follows Tao

> 從為也
To follow means to do.
人為事當如道
安静
不當如飄風驟雨
In doing business one ought to be like Tao,
peaceful and quiet,
not like a whirlwind or a shower.

>> The explanation "to follow means to do" is missing in the Che-yao.

道者同於道
is a Taoist who becomes identical with Tao.

> 道者謂好道人也
By a Taoist a man who loves Tao is meant.
同於道者所謂與道同
To become identical with Tao means to identify oneself with Tao.

>> The v.1. 爲 "is" instead of 謂 "means" is rejected by Li Ch'iao.

德者同於德
A Teist becomes identical with Te.

> 徳謂好德人也
By a Teist a man who loves Te is meant.
同於徳者所謂與徳同也
To become identical with Te means to identify oneself with Te.

>> Li Ch'iao's reading 德 instead of | 者 is probably a mere misprint.
It must doubtless be rejected, as the text as well as the wording
of the preceding parallel explanation require 德者.

失者同於失
A Sheist becomes identical with She.

> 失謂任己失人也
She means to give way to oneself and to lose the others.
同於失者所謂與失同也
To become identical with She means to identify oneself with She.

>> I have not translated She (失 "loss"),
as Ho-shang-kung's explanation as well as Lao-tse's text itself
show that in all probability She is a personification,
perhaps like Tao and Te a divinity (of the pantheon of Ch'u?).

同於道者
道亦樂得之
Who becomes identical with Tao,
Tao is also glad to get him.

> 與道同者
道亦樂得之也
If somebody identifies himself with Tao,
Tao is also glad to get him.

同於德者
德亦樂得之
Who becomes identical with Te,
Te is also glad to get him.

> 與徳同者
徳亦樂得之也
If somebody identifies himself with Te,
Te is also glad to get him.

同於失者
失亦樂失之
Who becomes identical with She,
She is also glad to get him.

> 與失同者
失亦樂失之也
If somebody identifies himself with She,
She is also glad to get him.

>> The three foregoing explanations clearly show that Ho-shang-kung
as well as Lao-tse himself here regards
not only Tao but also Te and She as personal beings.
In the last sentence, Li Ch'iao reads 失 "to lose" instead of 得 te "to get".
In view of the parallelism of the foregoing sentences,
this is probably wrong, therefore I have altered she into te.
If Li Ch'iao's reading should be correct,
it can of course not be understood to mean
"She is glad to lose him" but must be interpreted as
"She is also glad to make him a She" i.e. to identify him with itself.
--- In the Tao-tsang edition,
the explanations of the last three sentences are missing.

信不足焉
If faith is not sufficient,

> 君信不足於下
下則應君以不足也
If the prince has not sufficient faith in his subjects,
then the subjects are equally without faith in their prince.

>> The v.1. 不足 "insufficient" instead of 不信 "without faith"
is rightly rejected by Li Ch'iao.

有不信焉
then there is no faith.

> 此言
This means:
物□[^23-1]相歸
Things of the same sort turn towards each other;
同聲相應
harmonious sounds correspond to each other.
雲從龍
風從虎
Clouds follow the dragon,
winds follow the tiger.
水流濕
火就燥
Water flows to the wet,
fire approaches the dry.
自然之□也
This is the calculation of what is natural.

>> Instead of 數 "calculation" v.1. 類 "kind", rejected by Li Ch'iao.
