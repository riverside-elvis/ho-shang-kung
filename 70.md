# Ch. 70 知難 How to know difficulties.

吾言甚易知甚易行
The words of the ego are very easy to know and very easy to follow.

> 老子言吾所言省而易知
約而易行
Lao-tse knows that what the ego says is little and easy to know,
simple and easy to follow.
{易並以䜴反}

天下莫能知
莫能行
Within the empire nobody is able to know them,
and nobody is able to follow them.

> 人惡柔弱好剛強也
Men loathe what is tender and weak and like what is hard and strong.

言有宗
Words have an ancestor.
事有君
Deeds have a master.

> 我所言
有宗祖根本
What the ego says,
has an ancestor and a master.
事有君臣
天下
Among deeds there are princes and subjects,
superiors and inferiors.
世人不知者
Then men of the world do not know this.
非我之無德
不與我反
This is not because the ego had no Te
but because the mind is opposed to the ego.

夫唯無知
是以不我知
Now because this is unknown,
therefore the ego is unknown.

> That the men of the world do not know this
is because of the obscurity and external invisibility of the Tao and Te of the ego,
the mystery of its extreme infinity and subtility.
Therefore they do not know this.

>> "Tao" is wanting in one edition.
Instead of 闇昧 "invisibility" v.1. 昧, which has the same meaning.
A variant reads:
{夫惟聖人也
是我德之暗不見於外
窮極微妙}
Now it is the saint
who pushes the Te of the ego in its obscurity and outward invisibility
to the extreme boundaries of the subtle and the mysterious. 
{故无知也}
Therefore he is unknown.

知我者希
Those who know the ego are few.
則我者貴
Therefore the ego is of value.

> 希少也
希 = 少 few.
惟逹道者乃能知我
Only he who penetrates Tao may recognize the ego.
故為貴也
Therefore it is of value.

是以聖人被褐懷玉
Therefore the saint dresses in haircloth and hides the gem within his bosom.

> 被褐者薄外
Who dresses in haircloth is outwardly simple.
懐玉者厚內
Who hides a gem within his bosom has inward fulness.
匿寶
藏懐
不以示人也
Hide your treasures,
conceal your Te
and do not show it to others.
{褐户葛反}

>> The Che-yao, instead of the last sentence,
gives only the words 爲貴也 "and is of value".
