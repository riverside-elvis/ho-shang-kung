[^introduction-1]: Sui-shu 34, 1a; reproduced in Wieger, Taoisme, I, 264.

[^introduction-2]: The Lü-shi Ch'un-ch'iu 10, 4
(p. 127 of Wilhelm's translation)
mentions a Chiang-shang-che-chang-jen 江上之丈人
"old man of the bank of the Yang-tse"
who lived there at the time of the minister Wu Yün of Wu (about B.C. 500),
and the Shi-chi 80, 4a (in Se-ma Ch'ien's final remarks to Yo Yi's biography)
a Ho-shang-chang-jen 河上丈人 "old man of the bank of the Huang-ho",
a Taoist hermit of the third century B.C.
The Sui-shu 34, Ia speaks of a commentary
written by this Ho-shang-chang-jen which was then lost
but is said to have existed under the Liang dynasty (50-556).
The identity of this so-called commentary of the Ho-shang-chang-jen
with that of Ho-shang-kung was asserted by Wang Ying-lin 王應麟 of
the Sung time
(Han-shu i-wen che k'ao-cheng,
reprinted in Wang Chung-min 王重民, Laotse k'ao 老子考, pp. 36-37)
and is today almost generally accepted;
comp. Ma Hsü-lun, Lao-tse ho-ku I, 2a/b;
Wang Chung-min, 1. c. pp. 51-53; Pelliot in T'oung-pao, 13, 366 a.f.

[^introduction-3]: Ko Hsüan's preface is reprinted in
Wang Chung-min, 1. c. pp. 33-36,
where he is called Ko hsien-weng 葛仙翁 "the holy old man Ko".
Comp. his biography in Chung-kuo jen-ming ta ts'e-tien, p. 1307.

[^introduction-10]: This connection is also mentioned by Li Ch'iao, Lao-tse ku-chu 2, 24b.

[^introduction-11]: Comp. Erkes, Arthur Waley's Laotse-Übersetzung,
Artibus Asiæ (1935), 301-302.
I have shown in the same review (pp. 298-299)
that the assumption of a common source to which both authors
might go back is in such cases inadmissible if no special proof is available.

[^introduction-12]: Pelliot in T'oung-pao 19, 325 and 428/29.

[^introduction-13]: Comp. SBE 39, 8/9.
Of high value are the discussions on the chapter-headings
which Castellani adds to every chapter of his translation
(La regola celeste di Lao-tse, Firenze, 1927),
whereas the explanations given by Legge in SBE 39
are of no great importance.

[^introduction-14]: Pelliot in T'oung-pao 13, 370.

[^introduction-15]: T'oung-pao 19, 428.

[^introduction-16]: See Ts'e-yüan s.v. 十方.
On another doubtful indication of Buddhist influence see note on ch. 4.

[^introduction-17]: Li Ch'iao 李翹, Lao-tse ku-chu 老子古注 (1922), 2 vols.
Several editions from which Li Ch'iao quotes variants were inaccessible to me
and are therefore not specially mentioned.

[^introduction-18]: Tao-te-chen-ching-chu 道德眞經註,
Tao-tsang no. 676, reprint of 1926.
The edition contains four parts (in one volume),

pt. 3 chs. 38-59,
pt. 4 chs. 60-87.
