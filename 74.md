# Ch. 74 制惑 How to restrict doubts.

民不畏死
When the people do not fear death,

> 治國者
刑罰酷深
民不聊生
When the ruler of a country
deals out punishments in a very cruel way,
then the people do not live carefree.
故不畏死也
Therefore they do not fear death.
治身者
嗜欲傷神
貪財殺身
民不知畏之也
When in practising asceticism
he hurts the spirits through desire
and kills the body through greed for wealth,
then the people do not know fear.

柰何以死懼之
How can one frighten them with death?

> 人君不寛刑罰
教民去情
If the prince is not large-minded as regards punishments,
he causes the people to flee from quietude.
欲柰何設刑法
Why does he then want to fix punishments and laws?
以死懼之
To frighten them by death.

若使民常畏死
When one always causes people to fear death,

> 當除已之所殘剋
教民去利欲也
One must eliminate what does harm to the self
and teach the people how to do away with noxious desires.

>> Instead of 利欲 "noxious desires"
v.1. | | 之心 "the hankering after noxious desires".

而為竒者
吾得執而殺之
孰敢
Then, if they become queer
and I seize and kill them,
who dares?

> 以道教化
而民不從
反為竒巧
乃應王法執而殺之
If one improves them by Taoism
and the people do not follow
but become deceitful,
then it is adequate to the king to seize and kill them.
誰敢有犯者
Who would then dare to stir rebellion?
老子傷時王
不先道德化之
而先刑罰
Lao-tse is sorry for the kings of his time
who did not first improve by Tao and Te
but proceeded [at once] with punishments.

>> Instead of 王 "kings" v.1. 主 "rulers".

常有司殺者
There is always the master of killing who kills.

> 司殺者天
The master of killing is heaven.
居高臨下
It stays above and looks down.
司察人過
It surveys, as their master, the crimes of men.
天網恢恢
踈而不失也
The net of heaven is very wide-meshed,
it is coarse and still loses nothing.

>> The last sentence repeats the concluding sentence of the foregoing ch. 73.

夫代司殺者
是謂代大匠斵
If now the master of killing who kills is supplanted,
this is called supplanting the great carpenter.

> 天道至明
The way of heaven is highest enlightenment.
司殺者常
猶春生
夏長
秋□[^74-1]
冬藏
The master of examinations is always there,
as spring generates,
summer makes grow,
autumn perfects
and winter buries.
斗杓運移
以節度行之
The handle of the Dipper turns
and regulates them.
人君欲代殺之
是猶拙夫
代大匠斵木
If the prince wants to supplant the killer,
this is like an unskilled fellow who wants to supplant a carpenter.
勞而無功也
He toils and achieves nothing.
{斵陟角反}

>> Instead of 司察者常 "the master of examinations is always there"
v.1. | | 有 | "the master of examination has endurance".
Instead of 成 "perfects" v.1. 收 "reaps".
Instead of 枘 "handle" v.1. 杓, with the same meaning.
It is not clear who is meant by the Se-ch'a 司察 "master of examinations",
if he is not a mere mistake for the Se-sha "master of killing",
but there is no variant pointing to such an error.

夫代大匠斵者
希有不傷手者矣
Now if the great carpenter is supplanted,
there are few who will not hurt their hands.

> 人君行刑罰
猶拙人代大匠斵
則方圓不得其理
還自傷
If a prince proceeds with punishments
like an unskilled fellow who wants to supplant a carpenter,
he will not achieve the right thing, neither in the square nor in the round,
but cut his own hands.
代天殺者
失紀綱
Who wants to supplant the celestial killer
will lose his principles.
不得其紀綱
還受其殃也
Who does not keep to his principles draws misfortune upon himself.

>> Instead of 人 "fellow" v.1. 夫 "man".
The words 其手 "his hands" are missing in one edition.
Instead of 還受 "draws" v.1. 反 |, the same.
Instead of the final particle 也 v.1. 矣.
