# Ch. 77 天道 On the way of heaven.

天之道其猶張弓乎
Should the way of heaven not resemble the bending of a bow?

> 天道暗昧
It is the way of heaven to be dark and profound.
舉物□[^77-1]以為喻也
It chooses the different sorts of things to use them for examples.

>> Instead of 邈 "profound" v.1. 味 "obscure".

高者抑之
It presses down what is high.
下者舉之
It raises what is low.
有餘者損之
It diminishes what has too much.
不足者與之
It enriches what has too little.

> 言
This means:
張弓和調之
In bending a bow it is adjusted.
如是乃可用
Being so it can be used.
夫抑高舉下
損強益弱
天之道也
For when the high is pressed down and the low drawn upwards,
the strong diminished and the weak repleted,
then this is the way of heaven.

>> At the end of the first sentence, there is a variant containing 義:
"This is the method of adjusting a bow by bending it."
At the close of the second sentence, a variant has the final particle 耳.

天之道損有餘而□[^77-2]不足
It is the way of heaven to diminish what has too much and to replete what has not enough.

> 天道損有餘而益謙
It is the way of heaven to diminish what has a surplus and to replete what is deficient.
常以中和為上
It always thinks adjustment to be superior.

>> The words "to diminish what has a surplus and" are wanting in one edition.
Instead of 爲上 "to superior" v.1. 是尙 "to be preferable".

人之道則不然
The way of man is not like this.

> 人道則與天道反也
The way of man is contrary to that of heaven.

損不足以奉有餘
He diminishes what has not enough and repletes what has too much.

> 世俗之人損貧以奉富
The men of the world take from the poor to give to the rich.
奪弱以益強也
They rob the weak to benefit the strong.

孰能有餘以奉天下
Who is able to have abundance to give it to the empire?
唯有道者
Only he who has Tao.

> 言
This means:
誰能居有餘之位自省爵禄以奉天下不足者乎
Who is able to remain on the throne where he has got abundance and to be himself sparing with dignities and emoluments in order to give to those within the empire who have not got enough?
唯有道之君能行也
Only a prince possessing Tao is able to act thus.

是以聖人為而不恃
Therefore the saint acts without making claims.

> 聖人為德施不恃其報也
The saint produces Te and displays it without claiming recompense.

>> After 施 "displays" one reading has 惠 "benevolence",
meaning thus "and displays benevolence".
After 恃: "claims" one text adds 望 "longs",
thus reading "without claiming recompense or longing for it".

功成
而不處
When merit has been accomplished,
he does not stay.

> 功成事就
不處其位
By his merit he accomplishes his affairs,
and then he does not stay on the throne.

其不欲見賢
He does not wish to show himself as a worthy.

> 不欲使人知己之賢
He does not wish to show himself to men so that they may recognize the worthiness of his self.
匿功
不居榮
畏天
損有餘也
He declines merit,
does not stay within the splendour,
is afraid of heaven
and diminishes whatever has got too much.

>> Instead of 示 "to show himself" v.1. 使 "to employ".
Before 榮 one reading has 其 "within his splendour".
Instead of 榮 "splendour" v.1. 名 "glory".
